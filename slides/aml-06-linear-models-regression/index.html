# Linear models for Regression

02/11/19

Andreas C. Müller

???
So today we'll talk about linear models for regression.
You're probably familiar with some of the basics, and that's
where we'll start. But we'll also look into how to tune
these models, what the trade-offs are, and some more complex
techniques.
But first we'll start with some more preprocessing that we didn't get
to last week, in particular dealing with missing values, which you'll need for the homework.


FIXME polynomial features are used in linear model part. Move explanation there?
Or hold off on poly features at that place and use different data!!!!
FIXME remove 3d plots!
FIXME add missing value indicator
FIXME better explanations for imputation
FIXME L1 explanation unclear
FIXME alpha=14 vs alpha=31
FIXME adding features: use pipeline

# Sidebar: Dealing with Missing Values

This is for the homework. I didn't realize there were missing values in the continuous data.

# Dealing with missing values

- Missing values can be encoded in many ways
- Numpy has no standard format for it (often np.NaN) - pandas does
- Sometimes: 999, ???, ?, np.inf, “N/A”, “Unknown“ …
- Not discussing “missing output” - that’s semi-supervised learning.
- Often missingness is informative (Use `MissingIndicator`)

???

So first we're going to talk about imputation, which means
basically dealing with missing values. Before that, we're
going to talk about different methods to deal with missing
values. The first thing about missing values is that you
need to figure out whether your dataset has them and how
they encode it. If you're on Python, numpy has no standard
way to represent missing values while Pandas does and it's
usually nan. But the problem is usually more in the data
source. So depending on where your data comes from, missing
values might be encoded as anything. They might be
differently encoded for different parts of the data set. So
if you see some question marks somewhere, it doesn't mean
that all missing values are encoded as question marks. There
might be different reasons why data is missing. If you look
into like theoretical analysis missingness, often there you
can see something that's called missing at random or missing
completely at random, meaning that data was retracted
randomly from the dataset. That's not usually what happens.
Usually, if the data is missing, it's missing because
something when differently in a process, like someone didn't
fill out the form correctly, or someone didn't reply in a
survey. And very often the fact that someone didn't reply or
that something was not measured is actually informative.
Whenever you have missing values, it's often a good idea to
keep the information about whether the value was missing or
not. If a feature was missing, while we're going to do
imputation and we're going to try to fill in the missing
values. It's often really useful information that's
something was missing and you should record the fact and
represent it in the dataset somehow. We're only going to
talk about missing input today. You can also have missing
values in the outputs that are usually called
semi-supervised learning where you have the true target or
the true class only for some data points, but not for all of
them. So there's the first method which is very obvious.
Let's say your data looks like this. All my illustrations
today we'll be adding randomness to the iris data set.

hypothesises for the tests
---

]

???
So if my dataset looks like something on the left-hand side
here, then you can see that there are only missing values in
the first feature and it's mostly missing. One of the ways
to deal with this is just completely dropped the first
feature, and that might be a reasonable thing to do. If
there are so few values here that you don't think there's
any information in this just drop it I always like to
compare everything to a baseline approach. So your baseline
approach should be if there's only missing values in some of
the columns, just drop these columns, see what happens. You
can always iterate and improve on that but that should be
the baseline. A little bit trickier situation is that there
might be some missing values only for a few rows, the rows
are data points. You can kick out these data points and
train the model on the rest and that might be fine. There's
a bit of a problem with this though, that if you want to
make predictions on new data and the data that arrives has
missing values you'll not be able to make predictions
because you don't have a way to deal with missing values. If
you're guaranteed that any new test point that comes in will
not have missing values then doing this might make sense.
Another issue with dropping the rows with missing values is
that if this was related to the actual outcome then it might
be that you biased how well you think you're doing. Maybe
all the hard data points are the ones that have missing
values. And so by excluding them from your training data,
you're also excluding them from the validation. So it means
you think you're doing very well because you discarded all
the hard data points. Discarding data points is a little bit
trickier and it depends on your situation.

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_2.png)
]

???
The other solution is to impute them. So the idea is that
you have your training data set, you build some model of the
training data set, and then you fill in the missing values
using the information from the other rows and columns. And
you built a model for this and then you can also apply the
same imputation model on the test data set if you want to
make predictions. Question is what if it has all missing
values? Then you have no choice but drop that. If in the
dataset that happens, you need to figure out what you are
going to do. Like, if you have a production system, and
something comes in with all missing values, you need to
decide what you're going to do. But you probably cannot use
this data point for training model. You could like use the
outputs and train to find the mean outcome of all the values
that are missing.

# Imputation Methods

- Mean / Median
- kNN
- Regression models
- Matrix factorization (not in this lecture)

???
So let's talk about the general methods for data imputation.
So these are the ones that we are going to talk through. The
easiest one is me doing a constant value per column.
Imputing the mean or the medium of the column that we're
trying to compute. kNN means taking the average of KNearest
Neighbors. Regression means I build a regression model from
some of the features trying to rip the missing future. And
finally, elaborate probabilistic models. They try to build a
probabilistic model of the dataset and complete the missing
values based on this probabilistic model

# Baseline: Dropping Columns

.smaller[
```python

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_, y, stratify=y)

nan_columns = np.any(np.isnan(X_train), axis=0)
X_drop_columns = X_train[:, ~nan_columns]
scores = cross_val_score(LogisticRegressionCV(v=5), X_drop_columns, y_train, cv=10)
np.mean(scores)
```
0.772
]

???
Here’s my baseline, which is dropping the columns. I used
iris dataset where I had to put some missing values into the
second and third column. Here, x_score has like some missing
values, I split into test and training test data set and
then I drop all columns that have missing values and then I
can train logistic regression, which is sort of the model
I'm going to use to tell me how well does this imputation
work for classification. For my baseline, using a logistic
regression model and 10 fold baseline, I get 77.2% accuracy.

---

# Mean and Median

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_4.png)
]

???
The simplest imputation is mean or medium. Unfortunately,
only one is implemented in scikit-learn right now. If this
is our dataset, the imputation will look like this. For a
column, each missing value is replaced by the mean of the
column. The imputer is the only transformer in scikit-learn
that can handle missing data. Using the imputer you can
specify the strategy, mean or median or constant and then
you can call the method transform and that imputes missing
values.

---

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/median_imputation.png)
]

???
Here is a graphical illustration of what does this. So the
iris dataset is four-dimensional, and I'm plotting it in two
dimensions in which I added missing values. So, there are
two other dimensions which had no missing values, which you
can't see. The original data set is basically blue points
here, orange points here, green points here, and it's
relatively easy to separate. But here you can see that the
green points they have a lot of missingness, so they were
replaced by the mean of the whole dataset.

So there are two things about this. One, I kind of lost the
class information a lot. Two, the data is now in places
where there was no data before, which is not so great. You
could do smart things like doing the mean per class, but
that's actually not something that I've seen a lot.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalar

nan_columns = np.any(np.isnan(X_train), axis = 0)
X_drop_columns = X_train[:,~nan_columns]
logreg = make_pipeline(StandardScalar(), LogisticRegression())
scores = cross_val_score(logreg, X_drop_columns, y_train, cv=10)
np.mean(scores)
```
0.794
```python
mean_pipe = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy='median'),
                          StandardScalar(),
                          LogisticRegression())
scores = cross_val_score(mean_pipe, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
np.mean(scores)
```
0.729

???
Here's the comparison of dropping the columns versus doing
the mean amputation. We actually see that the mean
imputation is worse. In general, if you have very few
missing values, it might actually not be so bad and putting
in the mean might work.
Here I basically designed the dataset so that mean imputation fails.
This is not very realistic.

# KNN Imputation

- Find k nearest neighbors that have non-missing values.
- Fill in all missing values using the average of the
neighbors.
- PR in scikit-learn: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9212

???
FIXME illustration

In terms of complexity is using Nearest Neighbors. So the
idea is for each data point, we find the kNearest neighbors
and then fill in the missing values as the average of the
features of these neighbors. The difficulty here is
measuring distances if there are missing values. If there
are missing values, I can't just compute Euclidean
distances.

# Model-Driven Imputation

rf_imp = IterativeImputer(predictor=RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100))

np.mean(scores)
```
```
0.845
```
]

???
The next step up in complexity is using an arbitrary
regression model for imputation. I mean, arguably, the kNN
is also a regression model, but there's like some
intricacies that make it a little bit different. So the idea
with using a regression model is you do the first pass and
impute data using the mean. And then you try to predict the
missing features using a regression model trained on the
non-missing features and then you iterate this until stuff
doesn't change anymore. You can use any model you like, and
this is very flexible, and it can be fast if you have a fast
model.

#Feature Engineering

???
I want to talk a little bit about feature engineering and in
particular about interaction features. For linear models,
interaction features are actually quite interesting.

#Interaction Features

#Interaction Features

![:scale 70%](images/img_35.png)

???
If I fit the model, do logistic regression, I get something
like this, which does very badly. But if I do feature
engineering, it means I add new features to dataset which
will make my linear model more powerful. 
---

class: center, middle


![:scale 50%](images/img_36.png)

![:scale 70%](images/img_37.png)

???
So one idea would be to just add the product of the 2
existing features. So add a new feature that's like x zero
times x one, and now I'm in a 3-dimensional space. In the 3
dimensional space, I can literally separate the data.

---

.center[
![:scale 60%](images/img_38.png)
]

.smaller[
```python
X_i_train, X_i_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
	X_interaction, y, random_state=0)
logreg3 = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(X_i_train, y_train)
logreg3.score(X_i_test, y_test)
```
]
```
0.960
```

???
If it’s projected down to the original space, it will be
this black curve which is the logistic regression. So it's a
linear classifier only in the expanded 3-dimensional feature
space where it added the interaction. Interactions are one
way to who blow up the feature space, adding more features
in particular for linear models makes the model much more
powerful. So you can do this for continuous features. 


---

.center[![:scale 80%](images/img_40.png)]

- One model per gender!
- Keep original: common model + model for each gender to adjust.
- Product of multiple categoricals: common model + multiple models to adjust for combinations



???
For discrete features, it does something slightly different.
So assume I have a database of users with an age, how many
objects they bought, gender, how much money they spend on my
website, and how much time they spend on my website. So I
can Hot Encode the gender and they get like gender variable
at 01. So now if I do interaction features of all the
different features with the gender feature, it looks like
this. Now I have age times male, article bought times male,
males spend time, spend dollar male and so on and likewise
for female. This is just the interaction features but the
gender features are either zero or one. And so what this
means is, these features are only active for men, these
features only active for women. So learning a model on this
feature space is basically the same as learning two separate
models, one for men and one for women. What you might want
to do is use the original features, and then use the feature
interaction with men and the feature interaction with women.
So you have a shared model, and then you have how men and
women deviate from this model. So now you basically if you
do that you have three times as many degrees of freedom in
your linear model. 

---
# More interactions
.padding-top[
```
age articles_bought gender spend$ time_online
 + Male * (age articles_bought spend$ time_online )
 + Female * (age articles_bought spend$ time_online )
 + (age > 20) * (age articles_bought gender spend$ time_online)
 + (age <= 20) * (age articles_bought gender spend$ time_online)
 + (age <= 20) * Male * (age articles_bought gender spend$ time_online)
```
]

???
You can obviously do this with more discrete variables,
let's say you have the original features, then you have a
model that has the features only for men, a model that has
the features only for women, then you can have a model only
for people above 20, a model for people only below 20, a
model for people below 20 that are male, and so on. So by
adding these interaction features to basically create a
bigger, bigger features space, which allows you to have
linear models that adjust for a subpopulation of the overall
dataset. So now I have instead of having six features, I now
have 36 features and can have a much more powerful model.

You can also add polynomials. So the thing called polynomial
features in scikit-learn does interactions between all
possible features and it adds polynomials. If you do
interactions only equal to true, it will only do
interactions and then the order is how many features it
doesn't interactions with. Order of three means all products
of three features. By default interactions is false and
it’ll add also the powers of single feature, which only
makes sense for continuous features. So for each x it will
add x squared, x cube and so on. All right, that's all for
today.

# Linear Models for Regression

![:scale 50%](images/linear_regression_1d.png)

$$\hat{y} = w^T \mathbf{x} + b = \sum_{i=1}^p w_i x_i +b$$

???
Predictions in all linear models for regression are of the
form shown here: It's an inner product of the features with
some coefficient or weight vector w, and some bias or
intercept b. In other words, the output is a weighted sum of
the inputs, possibly with a shift. here i runs over the
features and x_i is one feature of the data point x. These
models are called linear models because they are linear in
the parameters w. The way I wrote it down here they are also
linear in the features x_i. However, you can replace the
features by any non-linear function of the inputs, and it'll
still be a linear model.

There are many differnt linear models for regression, and
they all share this formula for making predictions. The
difference between them is in how they find w and b based on
the training data.

---
# Ordinary Least Squares

$$\hat{y} = w^T \mathbf{x} + b = \sum_{i=1}^p w_i x_i +b $$

`$$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i + b - y_i||^2$$`

Unique solution if $\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{x}_1, ... \mathbf{x}_n)^T$ has full column rank.
???
The most straight-forward solution that goes back to Gauss
is ordinary least squares. In ordinary least squares, find w
and b such that the predictions on the training set are as
accurate as possible according the the squared error. That
intuitively makes sense: we want the predictions to be good
on the training set. If there is more samples than features
(and the samples span the whole feature space), then there
is a unique solution. The problem is what's called a least
squares problem, which is particularly easy to optimize and
get the unique solution to.

However, if there are more features than samples, there are
usually many perfect solutions that lead to 0 error on the
training set. Then it's not clear which solution to pick.
Even if there are more samples than features, if there are
strong correlations among features the results might be
unstable, and we'll see some examples of that soon.

Before we look at examples, I want to introduce a popular
alternative.

---
# Ridge Regression

`$$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n (w^T\mathbf{x}_i + b - y_i)^2 + \alpha ||w||^2 $$`

Always has a unique solution.

Tuning parameter alpha.

???
In Ridge regression we add another term to the optimization
problem. Not only do we want to fit the training data well,
we also want w to have a small squared l2 norm or squared
euclidean norm. The idea here is that we're decreasing the
"slope" along each of the feature by pushing the
coefficients towards zero. This constraings the model to be
more simple.

So there are two terms in this optimization problem, which
is also called the objective function of the model: the data
fitting term here that wants to be close to the training
data according to the squared norm, and the prenalty or
regularization term here that wants w to have small norm,
and that doesn't depend on the data.

Usually these two goals are somewhat opposing. If we made w
zero, the second term would be zero, but the predictions
would be bad. So we need to trade off between these two. The
trade off is problem specific and is specified by the user.
If we set alpha to zero, we get linear regression, if we set
alpha to infinity we get a constant model. Obviously usually
we want something in between.

This is a very typical example of a general principle in
machine learning, called regularized empirical risk
minimization.

---
# (regularized) Empirical Risk Minimization

`$$ min_{f \in F} \sum_{i=1}^n L(f(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i) + \alpha R(f) $$`

???
FIXME pointers data fitting / regularization!

Many models in machine learning, like linear models, SVMs
and neural networks follow the general framework of
empirical risk minimization, which you can see here. We
formulate the machine learning problem as an optimization
problem over a family of functions. In our case that was the
family of linear functions parametrized by w and b. The
minimization problem consists of two parts, the data fitting
part and the model complexity part. The data fitting part
says that the predictions mad eby our functions should be
accurate according to some loss L. For our regression
problems that was the squared loss. The model complexity
part says that we prefer simple models and penalizes
complicated f. Most machine learning algorithms can be cast
into this, with a particular choice of family of functions
f, loss function L and regularizer R. And most of machine
learning theory is build around this framework. People proof
for differnt choices of F and L and R that if you minimize
this, you'll be able to generalize well. And that makes
intuitive sense. To do well on the test set, we definitely
want to do reasonably well on the training set. We don't
expect that we can do better on a test set than the training
set. But we also want to minimize the performance difference
between training and test set. If we restrict our model to
be simple via the regularizer R, we have better chances of
the model generalizing.

# Reminder on model complexity

![:scale 80%](images/overfitting_underfitting_cartoon_full.png)

???
I hope this sounds familiar from what we talked about last
time. This is a particular way of dealing with overfitting
and underfitting. For this framework in general, or for
ridge regression in particular, trading off the data fitting
and the regularization changes the model complexity. If we
set alpha high we restrict the model, and we will be on the
left side of the graph. If we make alpha small, we allow the
model to fit the data more, and we're on the right side of
the graph.

Ok after all this pretty abstract talk, let's make this
concrete. Let's do some regression on the boston housing
dataset. After the last homework you're hopefully familiar
with it. The idea is to predict prices of property in the
boston area in different neighborhoods. This is a dataset
from the 70s I think, so everything is pretty cheap. Most of
the features you can see are continuous, with the exception
of the charlston river variable which says whether the
neighborhood is on the river.

Keep in mind that this data lives in a 13 dimensional space
and these univariate plots only look at 13 different
projections of the data, and can't capture any of the
interactions.

But still we can see that the price clearly depends on some
of these variables. It's also pretty clear that the
dependency is non-linear for some of the variables. We'll
still start with a linear model, because its a very simple
class of models, and I'd always star approaching any model
from the simplest baseline. In this case it's linear
regression. We're having 506 samples and 13 features. We
have much more samples than features. Linear regression
should work just fine. Also it's a tiny dataset, so
basically anything we'll try will run instantaneously, which
is also good to keep in mind.

Another thing that you can see in this graph is that the
features have very different scales. Here's a box plot that
shows that even more clearly.
---

![:scale 80%](images/boston_scaling.png)

???
That's something that will trip up the distance based models
models we talked about last time, as well as the linear
models we're talking about today.  For the penalized models
the different scales mean that different features are
penalized differently, which you usually want to avoid.
Usually there is no particular semantics attached to the
fact that one feature has different magnitutes than another.
We could measure something in inches instead of miles, and
that would change the outcome of the model. That's certainly
not something we want. A good idea is to scale the data to
get rid of this effect. We'll talk about that and other
preprocessing methods in-depth on Wednesday next week. Today
I'm mostly gonna ignore this. But let's get started with
Linear Regression

Let’s look at two simple models. Linear regression and Ridge
regression. What I've done is I’ve split the data into
training and test set and used 10 fold cross-validation to
evaluate them. Here I use cross_val_score together with the
model, the training data, training labels, and 10 fold
cross-validation. This will return 10 scores and I'm going
to compute the mean of them. I'm doing this for both linear
regression and Ridge regression. Here is ridge regression
uses a default value of alpha of 1. Here these two scores
are quite similar.

`$$ R^2(y, \hat{y}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2} $$`

`$$ \bar{y} =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} y_i$$`

Can be negative for biased estimators - or the test set!

???
The scores are R squared or coefficient of determination.
This is basically a score that's usually between zero and
one, where one means perfect prediction or perfect
correlation and zero means a random prediction. What it does
is it computes the mean of the targets over the data you're
evaluating it on and then it looks at the distance between
the prediction and the ground truth relative to the mean. If
it's negative, it means you do a worse job at predicting and
just predicting the mean. It can happen if your model was
really bad and bias. The other reason is if you use a test
set. This is guaranteed to be positive on the data it was
fit on with an unbiased linear model, which will nearly
never apply to what we’re doing.

The R^2 can be misleading if there's outliers in the training
data and some consider it a bad metric. Max Kuhn, author of APM
thinks it's a bad metric. It's not clear to me that MSE is much
better in general, though. Reducing anything to a single number
is tricky.

# Scaling

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
???
If you want to scale the data, you can use StandardScaler
for that. It makes the mean zero and the standard deviation
one. It's an unsupervised model, so it only takes the data
X_train to fit. Fitting just means computing mean and
standard devitation. Then, we can scale the data using the
transform method. Make sure that you fit the data only on
the training set, and then transform the training and the
test set. If you want to use scaling inside
cross-validation, it's a little bit more tricky. As I said,
more details next wednesday. I'm just mentioning this here
because it might come in handy for the homework.

Ok but so let's come back to the Ridge model. Above we just
used the default setting for the parameter alpha, which is
one. This is a reasonable default, but there is no reason
why this should give us the optimum generalization
performance on this problem. So it's a good idea to adjust
the parameter. As we saw on Monday, we can easily do that
with gridsearchCV.

Coming back to the ridge regression we used the standard
alpha of one which is a reasonable default, but by no means,
this is guaranteed to make sense in this particular problem.
Here I’ve done the grid search. As we talked about on
Monday, I defined a parameter grid where the key is the
parameter I want to search (alpha in Ridge) and the
parameters I want to try. For regularization parameters,
like alpha, it’s usually good to do them on the logarithmic
grid. I do a relatively fine grid here with 13 different
points mostly because I wanted to have a nice plot. In
reality, I would use a three or six or something like that.
I’ve instantiated GridSearchCV with Ridge(), the parameter
grid and do 10 fold cross-validation and then I called
grid.fit. I’ve reported the mean training accuracy and mean
test accuracy over 10 cross-validation folds for each of the
parameter settings. Okay, you can see a couple things here.
A) There's a lot of uncertainty B) The training set is
always better than the test set. C) The most important thing
that you can see here is that regularization didn't help.
Making alpha as small as possible is the best. What I'm
going to do next is I'm going to modify this dataset a
little bit so that we can see the effect of the
regularization. I’m going to modifying by using a polynomial
expansion, again we're going to talk about a little bit more
on Wednesday.

# Adding features

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures, scale
poly = PolynomialFeatures(include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(scale(X))
print(X_poly.shape)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_poly, y)
```
```
(506, 104)
```
```python
np.mean(cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.74
```
```python
np.mean(cross_val_score(Ridge(), X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.76
```

???
Basically, I'm adding a whole bunch of more features, which
is the interaction between all pairs of features and to
square for each feature. This allows me to learn not an only
linear function, but any polynomial of degree 2 of the
features, which gives me 104 features. Now there are way
more features in relation to the training data size. It's
still fewer features than data points, but unlike before
now, they're in the same order of magnitude. Now, this is a
problem that's much harder for linear regression without
regularization. Keep in mind the power of the linear models
really depends a lot on the dimensionality of the input
space. Previously I had 16 degrees of freedom and now I have
140 degrees of freedom, so I can learn a much more complex
model now. You can also think about this in terms of a 2D
problem, you draw a linear line, it seems to be very, very
restrictive. But if you look at a very high dimensional
space, if you have more features than samples, then you can
solve any problem perfectly. So it's not restrictive at all.
The powerfulness of the linear models depends a lot on the
majority of the features.

Let's look at what happens if you do a Grid search. You can
see a clear fit, hopefully, it looks to you a lot like the
cartoon curve that I did before. If we increase alpha, the
model gets less complex and the training performance goes
down. But if I increase regularization, the test score goes
up for a while and if I make it too strong, it goes down.
You can also see that the standard deviation is much higher
with less regularization than it is with more
regularization. This is sort of a more robust model and it
generalizes this better. Using regularization, I found the
best alpha and the best R square. It actually improved quite
a bit. The alpha doesn't really mean anything depending on
how you scale your data, don't think too much about that.

# Plotting coefficient values (LR)

```python
lr = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
plt.scatter(range(X_poly.shape[1]),
            lr.coef_, c=np.sign(lr.coef_), cmap="bwr_r")
```
.center[

???
In the previous slide, linear regression did nearly as well
as the Ridge Regression with the default parameters but
let's look at the coefficients of a linear model. These are
the coefficients of the linear model trained on the
polynomial futures. I plot them adding a color to represent
positive and negative. The magnitude here is 1 and then 13
zeros. We have two features, one is like, probably more than
trillions times two and then there's another one that's very
negative. What I conclude from this is, these 2 features are
very highly correlated. The model makes both of them really,
really big and then they cancel each other out. This is not
a very nice model, because it relates to American stability
and also it tells me that these 2 features are like
extremely important, but they might not be important at all.
Like the other features might be more important, but they're
nullified by this cancellation effect. They (0.2 and -0.8)
need to cancel each other out because the predictions are
reasonable and all the houses only cost like $70,000.

# Ridge Coefficients

```python
ridge = grid.best_estimator_
plt.scatter(range(X_poly.shape[1]), ridge.coef_,
            c=np.sign(ridge.coef_), cmap="bwr_r")
```
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/ridge_coefficients.png)
]

???
Let's look at the Ridge model. This is the best estimator,
which is the model that was found in a grid search with the
best parameter settings. This looks much more reasonable.
This feature, which was a very negative one, still is very
negative. But now this is actually three and minus three. So
this is a much more reasonable range. We can also look at
the features and the effect of different values of alpha.
Here is a Ridge with 3 different values of alpha. In the
previous random seat, alpha equal to 14 was the best now and
now we have it equal to 30 something. The green one is more
or less the best setting and then there's a smaller and a
bigger one. You can see that basically what alpha does is,
on average, it pushes all the coefficients toward zero. So
here you can see this coefficient shrank going from 1 to 14
going to 0 and the same here. So basically, they all push
the different features towards 0. If you look at this long
enough, you can see things that are interesting, the first
one with alpha equal to one it's positive, and with alpha
equal to 100, it's negative. That means depending on how
much you regularize the direction of effect goes in opposite
directions, what that tells me is don't interpret your
models too much because clearly, either it has a positive or
negative effect, it can't have both. 

---
```python
ridge100 = Ridge(alpha=100).fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge1 = Ridge(alpha=1).fit(X_train, y_train)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))

plt.plot(ridge1.coef_, 'o', label="alpha=1")
plt.plot(ridge.coef_, 'o', label="alpha=14")
plt.plot(ridge100.coef_, 'o', label="alpha=100")
plt.legend()
```

.center[
![:scale 60%](images/ridge_coefficients_alpha.png)
]

???
One other way to visualize the coefficient is to look at the
coefficient path or regularization path. On the x-axis is
the alpha, and on the y-axis, the coefficient magnitude.
Basically, I looped over all of the different alphas and you
can see how they shrink towards zero to increase alpha.
There are some very big coefficients that go to zero very
quickly and some coefficients here that stay the same for a
long time.

# Learning Curves

![:scale 90%](images/ridge_learning_curve.png)

???
The thing I want to illustrate is if you have less data,
regularization helps more. You can see the effects here
between the orange and the red are very drastic. The green
one probably has too much regularization. If you have very
little data, even regularizing way too much is okay, but
there's sort of a sweet spot here which is the orange one
and the orange one does best. The more data you add, the
less important regularization becomes. If you take the blue
curve at the beginning it’s much higher than the red curve,
but then, in the end, they overlap.

# Lasso Regression

`$$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i + b - y_i||^2 + \alpha ||w||_1 $$`

- Shrinks w towards zero like Ridge

- Sets some w exactly to zero - automatic feature selection!

???
Lasso Regression looks very similar to Ridge Regression. The
only thing that is changed is we use the L1 norm instead of
the L2 norm. L2 norm is the sum of squares, the L1 norm is
the sum of the absolute values. So again, we are shrinking w
towards 0, but we're shrinking it in a different way. The L2
norm penalizes very large coefficients more, the L1 norm
penalizes all coefficients equally. What this does in
practice is its sets some entries of W to exactly 0. It does
automatic feature selection if the coefficient of zero means
it doesn't influence the prediction and so you can just drop
it out of the model. This model does features selection
together with prediction. Ideally what you would want is,
let's say you want a model that does features selections.
The goal is to make our model automatically select the
features that are good. What you would want to penalize the
number of features that it uses, that would be L0 norm.

]]
???
The L0 norm penalizes the number of features that are not
zero. The L1 norm penalizes the absolute values. L2 norm
penalizes the squared norm. The problem with L0 norm is it's
one everywhere except at zero. And that's not
differentiable, it's not even continuous, so this is very
hard to optimize. Basically, we just gave up on this and we
use the next best thing we can do, which is the L1 norm. The
L1 norm is not differentiable, there’s like this kink in
zero, but we can still optimize it pretty well. The L2 norm
penalizes large values much more than small values.

]]]
???
Let's say I want to do a one-dimensional linear regression
problem. The problem to solve is something of this form. I
want my coefficients to be such that, let's say x, the one
coefficient I'm looking for and this is sort of the squared
loss function that I have. F is the daycare fitting term
here, and this is would be like some quadratic. The loss
function is in blue, its quadratic. The loss function plus
our L2 regularization, the ridge is in orange. The data
fitting plus L1 regularization is in green. The blue is a
squared quadratic function, the orange is a quadratic
function that sort of moved a little bit toward zero and the
green one also moved towards zero but there's a kink here.
Basically, this is just sort of the kink at the absolute
value of zero and that makes it much more likely that the
optimum will actually be at zero. So here the optimum for
orange is somewhere here, so it was pushed towards zero but
not exactly zero.

# Understanding L1 and L2 Penalties

![:scale 70%](images/l1l2ball.png)

A different way to visualize this is in two dimensions.
Let's say we have 2 coefficients. So one way to look at
these norms, let’s say we want to minimize the norm but say
we want to fix the norm, like more or less equivalent, these
are the L1 and L2 balls. So this is all the 2D vectors that
have Euclidean norm 1 or the ball and all the vectors that
have L1 norm is the diamond. Let's say we restrict ourselves
to a solution that lies on this ball.

---
class: center
# Understanding L1 and L2 Penalties

![:scale 70%](images/l1l2ball_intersect.png)
???
And then we have a quadratic function like this, this is
sort of the data fitting term again and so now if we want a
solution with L2 norm equal to zero, we get the solution
here, the intersection of the height lines of the data
fitting term and constraint to L2 norm. But for this
diamond, we're going to hit very likely one of the corners
just because of the geometry of the space, we're likely to
either of these corners. The corner means one of the
coefficients is exactly zero, and the other one is one. So
this is another sort of geometric realization of trying to
understand why does this lead to exact zeros hop.

# Grid-Search for Lasso
```python
param_grid = {'alpha': np.logspace(-3, 0, 13)}
print(param_grid)
```
```
{'alpha': array([ 0.001,  0.003, 0.01, 0.032, 0.1, 0.316, 1., 3.162,
                    10., 31.623, 100., 316.228, 1000.])}
```
```python
grid = GridSearchCV(Lasso(normalize=True), param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(grid.best_params_)
print(grid.best_score_)
```
```
{'alpha': 0.001}
0.837
```


???
Now we can do Grid Search again, the default parameters
usually don't work very well for Lasso. I use alpha on the
logarithmic grid. I fitted and then I get the best score.
---

![:scale 90%](images/lasso_alpha_search.png)

???
Looking at the training test set performance, you can see
that if you increase the regularization, this model gets
really bad. The ridge regression didn't go this badly. If
you set the realization to one, all coefficients become
zero. Other than that there's reasonable performance, which
is about as good as the ridge performance. 
---
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/lasso_coefficients.png)
]

```python
print(X_poly.shape)
np.sum(lasso.coef_ != 0)
```
```
(506, 104)
64
```

???
These are the coefficients of the model. Out of the 104
features, it only selected 64 that are non-zero, the other
ones are exactly zero. You can see this visualized here. The
white ones are exactly zero and the other ones on non-zero.
If I wanted I could prune the future space a lot and that
makes the model possibly more interpretable. There's a
slight caveat here if two of the features that are very
correlated, Lasso will pick one of them at random and make
the other one zero. Just because something's zero doesn't
mean it's not important. It means you can drop it out of
this model. If you have two features that are identical, one
of them will be zero and one of them will be not zero and
it's going to be randomly selected. That makes
interpretation a little bit harder.

# Elastic Net

- Combines benefits of Ridge and Lasso

- two parameters to tune.


`$$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i + b - y_i||^2 + \alpha_1 ||w||_1 +  \alpha_2 ||w||^2_2 $$`

???
You can also combine them. This actually what works best in
practice. This is what's called the Elastic Net. Elastic Net
tries to combine both of these penalizations together. You
now have both terms, you have the L1 norm and the L2 norm
and you have different values of alpha. Basically, this
generalizes both. If you choose both these are alpha, it can
become ridge and it can become Lasso, it can become any
anything in between. Generally, ridge helps generalization.
So it's a good idea to have the ridge penalty in there, but
also maybe if there are some features that are really not
useful, the L1 penalty helps makes the same exactly zero.

# Comparing unit balls

![:scale 70%](images/l1l2_elasticnet.png)

Looking at the unit balls, if you zoom in here you would see
the Elastic Net ball is kind of round, but also has a
corner. Important things are the corners because that allows
you to hit the exact zeros.

# Parametrization in scikit-learn
`$$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i + b - y_i||^2 + \alpha \eta ||w||_1 +  \alpha (1 - \eta) ||w||^2_2 $$`

Where $\eta$ is the relative amount of l1 penalty (`l1_ratio` in the code).
???
The way this parameterize in scikit-learn is slightly
different. In scikit-learn, you have a parameter alpha,
which is the amount of regularization and then there's a
parameter called l1_ratio, that says how much of the penalty
should be L1 and L2. If you make this one, you have Lasso,
if you make it zero, you have a Ridge. Don't use Lasso or
Ridge and set alpha zero, because the solver will not handle
it well. If you actually want alpha equal to zero, use
linear regression. Now we have more parameters to tune, but
we just have a more general model. This actually works
pretty well often.

# Grid-searching ElasticNet

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
param_grid = {'alpha': np.logspace(-4, -1, 10),
              'l1_ratio': [0.01, .1, .5, .9, .98, 1]}

grid = GridSearchCV(ElasticNet(), param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(grid.best_params_)

```
{'alpha': 0.0001, 'l1_ratio': 0.01}
0.718
```
???
Here is me doing a grid search. If you have two parameters
for the grid search it will do all possible combinations.
Here I do a logarithmic space for alpha and for the
l1_ratio, I use something that’s very close to zero and
something that's very close to one and some stuff in
between. If you want to analyze the output of a 2D grid
search a little bit harder we can’t do the nice curve
anymore.

# Analyzing grid-search results
```python
import pandas as pd
res = pd.pivot_table(pd.DataFrame(grid.cv_results_),
    values='mean_test_score', index='param_alpha', columns='param_l1_ratio')
```
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/elasticnet_search.png)
]
???
The way that I like to do it is, here's the grip.cv results.
And I put it in a data frame and then I'll make a pivot
table where the values are test score, the index is one
parameter and the columns are the other parameter. It allows
me to visualize the grid search nicely. This is alpha and
this is l1_ratio and you can see that if the l1_ratio is
pretty high, there are some pretty good results, if you set
the alpha accordingly. So here's like the diagonal of pretty
good things. This is the model that did best. There's a
slight caveat here that right now I did this with
cross-validation and so this is the cross-validation
accuracy. Last time I said, this is not really a good
measure of generalization performance. So here, I searched
way more parameters, I tried like 5 or 10 times as many
models. So it's likely that by chance, I'll get better
results. I didn't do this here in particular, because the
data set is small and very noisy but in practice, if you
want to compare models, you should evaluate it on a test set
and see which of the models actually are better on the test.
One more thing, why this is helpful is if the best value is
on the edge of this graph that means my ranges were too
small. Question is why we're using r square instead of the
squared loss, one of the answers is that's the default in
scikit-learn and the other answer is it's nice to know the
range so you know that perfect prediction is one and you
have some idea of what 0.5 means, the RMSE (the other norm
that you usually use is the RMSE) depends on the scale of
the output. So for example for the housing prices, it might
be interesting to see what is the standard error in terms of
dollars. If you want, like something that is in the units of
the output, RMSE is good or mean absolute error might even
be better. If you want something that is independent of the
units of the output r square is pretty good because you know
it's going to be between zero and one and it's measure
something like the correlation and so if it's like 0.9, you
know it’s a pretty good model. If my RMSE is 10,000 I don't
know if have a good model or a bad model depends on what the
range of the outputs is. The last thing I want to talk about
today is this was basically changing the regularization
parts. The two most times regularization we looked at is
Ridge which is L2 penalty, Lasso which is an L1 penalty and
combining two of them which is Elastic Net. So now I want to
talk about changing the first part, which was the squared
loss of the predictions, basically.
