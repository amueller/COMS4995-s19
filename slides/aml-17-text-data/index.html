# More kinds of data


- So far:
  * Fixed number of features
  * Contiguous
  * Categorical

--

- Next up:
  * No pre-defined features
  * Free text
  * Images
  * (Audio, video, graphs, ...: not this class)


???
So far we talked about data where we have a fixed number of
features, and where the features are either continuous or
categorical. And that is most of the data out there and the
simplest kind of data to work with.

The rest of the semester, we're going to talk about
different kinds of data that is opposite to what we already
worked with.

We'll look at data that has no predefined features. In
particular, we're going to look at free text and images.
We’re also going to look at time series, which is a similar
category of not having a clear way to express it as a
standard supervised learning task. Another common example in
this category is audio and video, we're not going to do any
audio or video in this lecture. But I think text and images
are the common types of data.


* Need to create fixed-length description

Here's an example of some text dataset that I'm going to use
later. This is like relatively typical text, its user input
data from IMDb movie reviews.

Clearly, they don't have the same length, there's no clear
way to express this is as like some folding point features
which we would use for a standard machine learning approach.
You can also see there are weird things about
capitalization, some weird words in there like Godzilla that
you might not see very often, there is some HTML markup,
there’s punctuation and so on. This is sort of how text
looks like in the wild very often. You could also do things
on much longer texts, like whole books, or articles or so
on.

People also work on text that's much shorter. Tweets are
still sort of their own domain. Working on tweets is quite
hard because they are very short.

I’m going to talk about a particular kind of data that you
see very often because it's often used. But there are other
kinds of data that is text data.

# Other Types of text data

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/other_types_of_text_data.png)
]

???
Here is a table of the text data consisting of people
sitting in the European Parliament. Each person has a
country, a name, an ID, a party, and a political
affiliation. The variable country here, you might hope that
it's categorical but for the European Union, actually, the
categories are well known. Though, if you have a user input
a country, they will never input the same country in the
same way. The UK could be the United Kingdom, or England, or
Britain, or Great Britain, and all of these might correspond
in this context to the same entity.

If you have users input this, they will also make typos.
This variable is representing a category concept but you
have to do some cleaning before you can actually convert it
into a category. This is often a manual thing to do. There
are things that can help you with this, like duplication or
an entity recognition but we're not going to talk about
that.

The names are strings. They are definitely not categorical,
and they’re also not words. So it's not really clear if
there’s like any information in the name and we're going to
look into this later today.

But you clearly don't want to treat them the same way as
words that you find in a dictionary.

We have the political groups and affiliations. Again, these
are sort of free texts. They're sort of similar to the
variable country only now there's many more of them, in a
sense, they try to encode a categorical variable, which
political group you're from, but they also have more
information, for example, you could also treat them as texts
like if there's freedom or democracy or Christianity or
something in the party title that will probably say
something. So you could either treat it as categorical or as
text and both will give you information. And you have the
same problem, that the same group can be referred with
different names or different spellings.

So there's this whole area of named entity recognition that
actually tries to extract from any text the named entities
and then tries to disambiguate. We're actually going to talk
about this, but it's also some particular kind of text data
that I want you to be aware of.

# Bag of Words
.center[
<br>
![:scale 85%](images/bag_of_words.png)
]
???
The most common approach that people use for this is bag of
words, which is a very simple approach.

We start with a string which would be your whole document.
The first step is to tokenize it, which is basically
breaking it up the document into words. And then, you built
a vocabulary over all documents over all words.

So you look over all the movie reviews, or all the emails or
the text you have, and you collect all the tokens which are
representing the words.

Finally, using the vocabulary, you create a group
representation. The length of your feature vector will be
the size of the vocabulary. For each word in the vocabulary,
you count how often this word appears in the string that you
want to encode.

Most of the words in the English language don't appear in a
sentence. So most of these entries will be 0. But the word
‘ants’ appears once, so increment the count for ‘ants’ by 1
and so on.

So I'll have 6 non-zero entries and all the other entries
will be 0. So this is what we call like a very sparse vector
so most entries of this vector are 0.

When coding this, we’ll use a sparse matrix encoding. The
idea of sparse matrix encoding is that you only store the
non-zero entries.

So basically, we will only store the 1s, so storing the
string as a bag of word will cost us a nearly 6 floating
point numbers.

# Toy Example




.smaller[
```python
malory = ["Do you want ants?",
          "Because that’s how you get ants."]
```
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vect = CountVectorizer()
vect.fit(malory)
print(vect.get_feature_names())
```

```
['ants', 'because', 'do', 'get', 'how', 'that', 'want', 'you']
```
```python
X = vect.transform(malory)
print(X.toarray())
```
```
array([[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
       [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]])
```


]

???
Here, I have a corpus. Corpus is what people in NLP called
datasets. My dataset is 2 strings, “Do you want ants?”,
“Because that's how you get ants.”

The bag of word representation is implemented in the count
vectorizer in scikit-learn, which is a
sklearn.feature_extraction.text

This is a transformer, it's kind of similar to most
transformers. The only difference is it takes in lists of
strings as input, not numeric data. Usually, transformers
take in a Numpy area as anything in scikit-learn.

But here, count vectorizer takes in a list of strings. I
gave the list of string and I fit it on my documents and
this builds the vocabulary. I can get back to vocabulary by
looking at the feature names using get_feature_names()

The vocabulary is sorted alphabetically. Vocabulary has 8
entries from ‘ants’ to ‘you’. So if I use this count
vectorizer to create like a word representation, then I'll
get an 8-dimensional feature space.

I can use this to transform the 2 documents that I have. X
here, being the outcome of the transform will be a sparse
matrix. So to print it, I call toarray() on it. So sparse
matrices are in scipy, and you can easily convert to and
from numpy arrays.

Usually, it's a very bad idea to convert to sparse matrix
into Numpy array, since usually, it will not fit into your
memory. If you have like a vocabulary of size 100,000 and
100,000 documents, and you make it into Numpy array, then
your memory will just fill up and your computer will crash
since you won’t have enough memory to store all the zeros.

In this toy example, we can easily convert this to a Numpy
array and you can see that this is the feature
representation. In this case, we only have 1s and 0s.

Each word appears either once or zero times. So here, in the
first string, the first feature is ‘ant’, so ‘ant’, ‘do’,
‘want’ and ‘you ’ appears once, ‘because’, ‘get’, ‘how’, and
‘that’ doesn't appear. The second string is processed in the
same way.

Q: What would you do if your document has more unique tokens
or tokens that are not in the vocabulary?

Usually, you either ignore them, that’s the default thing to
do. Your test set will have tokens that your training set
will not have, and so you can’t really learn anything about
that. One thing you could do is count how many words out of
the vocabulary there are.

We going to talk a little bit later about how to restrict
your vocabulary and you can basically add a new feature,
that says, “There's X amount of features that are not in the
vocabulary.” Often, this can be useful for people cascading
something or miss typing something or using names or
something like that.

But usually, you assume that most of the words appear in
your training data set.

Q: What if there are spelling errors?

You can treat them but by default, if you do that, they're
just different features. So they're completely unrelated. So
if there's a new spelling error in your test dataset that
never appeared in your training dataset, then the word will
be completely ignored.

You can use spell correction, I’ll talk about that in a bit.

If you don't do any spell correction, it will be a
completely distinct feature. Spell correction is also not
entirely trivial because there are many possible words.

Q: Does the count vectorizer trim the apostrophe in ‘that’s’
in the second string?

Yes, and as you can see, the question marks and the dots
also don't appear. And we're going to talk about how exactly
it works in a little bit.


Consider two documents in a dataset "malory"

class: spacious

# "bag"


```python
print(malory)
print(vect.inverse_transform(X)[0])
print(vect.inverse_transform(X)[1])
```

```
['Do you want ants?', 'Because that’s how you get ants.']
['ants' 'do' 'want' 'you']
['ants' 'because' 'get' 'how' 'that' 'you']
```


???
The reason why this is called a bag of words is since you're
completely ignoring the order of words. So you can do
inverse transform to get back the string representation from
the numerical representation but if you do that the
numerical representation doesn't contain the order of the
words so you will only get back ‘ants’ ‘do’ ‘want’ ‘you’ and
‘ants’ ‘because’ ‘get’ ‘how’ ‘that’ ‘you’

Basically, you store all the words in a big bag and
completely lose any context and any order of the words.
That's why it's called a bag of words.

# Text classification example:
# IMDB Movie Reviews
???
We're going to do a binary classification task on a dataset
of IMDb movie reviews. You can look on GitHub, I have the
notebook that runs through all of this if you want to run it
yourself.

The idea here is that we want to do sentiment analysis
basically classifying reviews into either being positive or
negative. In IMDb, they give stars from 0 to 10. This is
from a research paper where the author stated 1, 2 and 3 as
negative while 7, 8, 9 and 10 are positive.

---

# Data loading


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_files
reviews_train = load_files("../data/aclImdb/train/")

text_trainval, y_trainval = reviews_train.data, reviews_train.target
print("type of text_train: ", type(text_trainval))
print("length of text_train: ", len(text_trainval))
print("class balance: ", np.bincount(y_trainval))

```

```
type of text_trainval: <class 'list'>
length of text_trainval: 25000
class balance: [12500 12500]
```
???
Text data is in either it's in a CSV format or if they’re
longer documents, people in NLP like to have a single text
file for each data point.

There's a tool in scikit-learn that allows you to load data,
method load_files function, which basically iterates over
all the folders in a given folder. Each folder is supposed
to correspond to a class and then inside each folder, each
text document corresponds to a data point, that's a very
common format that people use for text data.

We can load this, then we get the actual data and the
targets.

Text_trainval is used as a training and validation set is
just a list. The length is 25,000. So there are 25,000
documents, and this is a balanced dataset meaning there are
12,500 positive and negative samples.

---

# Data loading
```python
print("text_train[1]:")
print(text_trainval[1].decode())
```
.smaller[
```
text_train[1]:
'Words can't describe how bad this movie is. I can't explain it by
writing only. You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how
horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that.
There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things
you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the
technical first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane. I
won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They
didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional
airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery.
Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only
much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that i
lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the bad guys' side all
the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive
Decision" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the
"Turbulence"-movies are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is
better than this one.'
```
]
???
We can also look at data points. I’m calling decode here to
print the Unicode characters.

The word ‘cliché’ can be typed with or without the axon and
they would be two different words. But also, you need to
determine if it’s a Unicode character or not. In Python 3,
by default, everything is a unique code.

---
# Vectorization

```python
text_train_val = [doc.replace(b"<br />", b" ")
                  for doc in text_train_val]
text_train, text_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    text_trainval, y_trainval, stratify=y_trainval, random_state=0)
vect = CountVectorizer()
X_train = vect.fit_transform(text_train)
X_val = vect.transform(text_val)
X_train
```

```
<18750x66651 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
  with 2580448 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
```
???
I removed all the irrelevant HTML formatting. And then I
split it into training and test set. Then I called the count
vectorizer. Then I fitted the training set and transform the
validation set.

Then it returns a 18750x66651 sparse matrix meaning there
are 18,750 samples and 66,651 features.

So the vocabulary that we built is 66,651. There’s 2.5
million stored elements (non-zero entries).

This is a much, much smaller number than the product of
these two numbers. So most of the entries are zero.

Remember, you need to know whether you are in Python 2 or 3
and then you need to know the type of text.

There are two different things that you need to keep in
mind. So the text can be a byte string or Unicode string.
But if it's a byte string, it also has an encoding attached
with it. You need to know the encoding to go from the byte
string to the string.

```python
print(feature_names[20000:20020])
```
.smaller[

['eschews', 'escort', 'escorted', 'escorting', 'escorts', 'escpecially', 'escreve',

 'principally', 'rebours', 'robotnik', 'sculptural', 'skinkons', 'stardom', 'syncer',
 'tools', 'unflagging', 'waaaay', 'yanks']
```
]
???
This is the first thing I do, it’s helpful to see if
something sensible happened. And you get an idea of the
data. I'm going to plot the first 10 data points, and I'm
going to plot some 20 in the middle and I'm going to plot
every 2000th data point.

The first couple of ones seem to be pretty boring. But then
it seems to do something relatively reasonable.

Now that we have the sparse matrix representation, we can
just do classification as usual.

---

# Classification

<br>


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV
lr = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(X_train, y_train)
```
```python
lr.C_
```
```
array([ 0.046])
```
```python
lr.score(X_val, y_val)
```
```
0.882
```
???
All the models in scikit-learn work directly on the sparse
matrix representation. Here, I do logistic regression CV so
it adjusts CR automatically for me. The validation set score
I get is 88% accuracy, which is pretty good.

Here, accuracy is meaningful because we know it's a balanced
dataset. The next thing I always like to do is look at the
coefficients.


---
class: middle

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/coefficients.png)
]
???
So here I'm looking at the 20 most negative and 20 most
positive coefficients of this logistic regression. It's
pretty easy to do because it's a binary task. If you have
multiclass tasks, you’ll have way more coefficients and it's
harder to visualize.

This seems to be like a pretty reasonable model to pick up
on the bad words and the good words. This is the baseline
approach.

class:spacious
# Soo many options!

- How to tokenize?
- How to normalize words?
- What to include in vocabulary?
???
In tokenization, there are many different options to change
what's happening here.

In particular, there's the tokenization, which is how do you
break it up into tokens. Then normalization, which is how do
you make tokens look sort of reasonable. And then what to
include in vocabulary.

---
class: spacious

# Tokenization
- Scikit-learn (very simplistic):
  * `re.findall(r"\b\w\w+\b")`
  * Includes numbers
  * discards single-letter words
  * `-` or `'` break up words
???
Scikit-learn is not an LLP library. Some very good Python
LLP libraries are NLTK and spacy. They have a lot more
things for doing text analysis. Scikit-learn only has quite
simple things.

In tokenization, what the count vectorizer does the regular
expression, “\b\w\w+\b”. That means it finds anything of
length 2 or longer that has word boundaries, which are any
punctuation or white spaces, and matches w.

As we saw, this includes any numbers. Numbers can be at the
beginning of the word, the middle of the word or it can be
just all numbers.

You don't include single letter work or single letter
numbers. So ‘I’ is always discarded. There’s an interesting
thing where you can get the gender of a person, depending on
how much often they use ‘I’.

It doesn't include any punctuation because we only use the
w, which is digits.

This is pretty simple and pretty restrictive.

---
# Changing the token pattern regex

```python
vect = CountVectorizer(token_pattern=r"\b\w+\b")
vect.fit(malory)
print(vect.get_feature_names())
```
```
['ants', 'because', 'do', 'get', 'how', 's', 'that', 'want', 'you']
```

--

```python
vect = CountVectorizer(token_pattern=r"\b\w[\w’]+\b")

vect.fit(malory)
print(vect.get_feature_names())
```
```
['ants', 'because', 'do', 'get', 'how', 'that’s', 'want', 'you']
```

???
If we just want to use a different regular expression, we
can do something simple, like changing the regular
expression. So here, for example, I removed one of the Ws
and so now I match everything that's a single letter or
more. So now I only the ‘s’ in ‘that’s’, without the
apostrophe, making it a single token.

I can also allow things to have an apostrophe in the middle
of the word, and get ‘that’s’ as a single token. This might
look nicer but actually, in reality, it usually doesn't
matter that much.

But you can play around with this and see if the tokens you
get with standard tokenization are good for your
application.

Again, spacy and NLTK have much more sophisticated things.
The X in vectorization slide represents the sparse matrix
representation of the data and Y represents if it’s a
positive or a negative review.



Was not actually an apostroph but some unicode pattern
because I copy & pasted the quote.

]
???
Normalization is basically how do you want to bring your
token in a standardized form. For example, you could get rid
of plurals or you could correct spelling. There are three
main methods.

Correct spelling, which only very few people use in
practice.

Stemming reduces words to their word stem. The idea is to
get rid of plural ‘s’ and ‘ing’ at the end of the verbs and
so on so that you don't have the conjugations. Stemming
removes some letters at the end of the word depending on a
fixed rule set.

Lemmatization also uses reduces the word stem but in a smart
way. It tries to parse the sentence and then uses a
dictionary of all English words with all its verb forms and
conjugations and tries to map it to a standardized form.

The reason why I picked this example is ‘meeting’ appears
twice in here, once as a noun and once as a verb. Using
stemming:
‘was’ becomes ‘wa’
‘worse’ becomes ‘wors’ and so on
‘I’m’ is just split up in two without the apostrophe.
‘scared’ becomes ‘scare’
‘meeting’ becomes ‘meet’

Lemmatization parsed the sentence and figured out that the
first ‘meeting’ is a noun and keeps it as it is but the
second ‘meeting’ which is a verb is simplified to ‘meet’.
You can also see that the ‘was’ was normalized to ‘be’ and
the ‘worse’ was normalized to ‘bad’ and the ’m was
normalized to ‘be’ as well.

The question with any kind of normalization you do is will
this be helpful for your application.

Q: is stemming only applicable to English literature?

These are both language dependent. This model exists for
many languages. Today, I’m only talking about languages that
work similar to English.

Scikit-learn only lowercases it. You can plug in other
normalization from NLTK or spacy into the count vectorizer
if you want, but the default is it lower cases the tokens.

# Restricting the Vocabulary
???
The other main thing that you can play with is restricting
the vocabulary. So far, I said, we're just going to use all
the tokens that we see.

One way to restrict the vocabulary often is to remove stop
words. Stop words, are words that are not so important to
the content and so you discard them.

If I do this for my example, the only thing that remains are
‘ants’ and ‘want’ because ‘this’, ‘I’ and ‘how’ are all stop
words.

Scikit-learn has some stop words built in. So if you do stop
word equal to English, it will use the built-in the stop
word list. It's a little bit strange and we're working on
improving it. So for example, there’s ‘system’ in the stop
word list and ‘bill’ is in the stop word list.

For unsupervised problems, using stop words might be
helpful. For supervised problems, I rarely found it helpful
with the tools that we talked about.

So problem is, these are nearly 200 words but we have 66,000
features, removing 200 features doesn't really make a
difference. And because these words appear very often, the
model won’t be able to figure out are they important or not.

If you use an unsupervised model, in the unsupervised model
since they appear so often, these might just dominate
whatever clustering you do and so removing them might be a
good idea.



- not a very good stop-word list? Why is system in it? bill?
- For supervised learning often little effect on large corpuses (on small corpuses and for unsupervised learning it can help)

# Infrequent Words

- Remove words that appear in less than 2 documents:

.smaller[
```python
vect = CountVectorizer(min_df=2)
vect.fit(malory)
print(vect.get_feature_names())
```
```
['ants', 'you']
```

]

- Restrict vocabulary size to max_features most frequent words:

.smaller[
```python
vect = CountVectorizer(max_features=4)
vect.fit(malory)
print(vect.get_feature_names())
```
```
['ants', 'because', 'do', 'you']
```

]

???
Another thing that is often helpful is removing infrequent
words. There's a parameter called min_df that basically
removes words that appear less than twice.

It'll only keep words that appeared twice or more, and so
only ‘ants’ and ‘you’ remain in the toy dataset example.

This is often useful because it can remove a lot of
features. And if a word appears only once in your data, it's
unlikely that your algorithm will be able to learn. If you
have hundreds of thousands of thousands of features, and one
feature appears once in your dataset, then it’s probably not
going to be helpful.

You can also go the other way around and set max_features.
Max_features sets the number of features that you want to
keep, in this case, four most common features.

It's kind of interesting, this goes a little bit in the
opposite direction of what the stop words do. The stop words
remove the most common ones that are meaningless and here,
we removed the most infrequent ones because they're probably
not helpful. These are often misspellings, or names or
something like that.

Here I used the count vectorizer with min_df=2 and min_df=4.
That means either use tokens that appear in 2 documents in a
training set, or at least 4 documents in a training set.

Min_df=2 gives me 39825 while min_df=4 gives me 26928. I’ve
drastically reduced the feature space when using min_df=2
and if I set min_df=4, I cut down feature space even more.

Min_df means minimum document frequency, meaning the number
of documents the words appear in. It's not the number of
times the word appears. So if a word appears in 100 times in
a single document, it's still going to be thrown out by
this.

Here, I used X_train_df=4, which is much, much smaller, it’s
less than half the size. And the result I get is identical,
basically, in terms of accuracy.

These are the main configuration you just used a single bag
of words.

That said, they're throwing away a lot of the context and
information. One way to improve upon this is what's called
N-grams.



- Removed nearly 1/3 of features!
- As good as before

# Tf-idf rescaling

$$ \text{tf-idf}(t,d) = \text{tf}(t,d)\cdot \text{idf}(t)$$

$$ \text{idf}(t) = \log\frac{1+n_d}{1+\text{df}(d,t)} + 1$$

$n_d$ = total number of documents <br/>
$df(d,t)$ = number of documents containing term $t$

--

* In sklearn: by default also L2 normalisation!

???
Next thing we can do is actually try to rescale our words
with something called Tf-idf which stands for Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency.

This is sort of an alternative to using soft stop words in a
sentence. The idea here is to down-weight things that are
very common.

It’s the logarithm of 1 over the number of documents
containing the term.

So if something happens to appear in most of the documents,
the inverse document frequency will give it a very low
weight. This is something that's very commonly used in
information retrieval.

Information retrieval basically means you're trying to find
relevant documents. If you can think of how a search engine
works, if you want to match a bag of words representation of
two different query strings, you might not care so much
about matching the ‘a’ and ‘the’, but you care a lot about
matching the parts that are rare and that are very specific
to a particular search term. That is the motivation for
this.

But people find it also sometimes helps in a machine
learning context.

You can’t really know in advance whether this helps for the
particular dataset or not, but basically you should keep in
mind, this emphasizes rare words and does a soft removal of
very common words. This also means the sort of stop words
here are corpus specific so here it will learn to
down-weight ‘movie’ and ‘film’ because they're very common.

The implementation of this in scikit-learn is a little bit
non-standard but I don't think it makes a big difference.

You should also keep in mind is that if you use the
implementation of TF-IDF in scikit-learn by default, it will
also do L2 normalization. L2 normalization means you divide
each row by its length. That means you normalize the weight
the length of the document. You only want to count how often
the word appears relative to how long the document is.
Basically, if you make a document that basically repeats
each word twice, it should still have the same
representation. By default, that's turned on for TF-IDF. But
it's not turned on for the bag of words.


* Emphasizes "rare" words - "soft stop word removal"
* Slightly non-standard smoothing (many +1s)

```

]
???
In scikit-learn, there are two ways to do this. You can
either use the TF-IDF vectorizer which you can use directly
on the text and it will build the vocabulary and then do the
rescaling. Or you can use to count vectorizer,
TFIDFTransformer, which will work on the sparse matrix
created by the count vectorizer and then just transform it
using rescaling.

This is an alternative to using stop words or putting more
emphasis on rare words.


Q: Explain the part about the L2 norm.

For the L1 norm, it might be easier to visualize. Dividing
by L1 norm would mean just dividing by word count and so
that would mean that basically, if you have a very long
review, and it says bad 3 times, but it says good 20 times,
then you only care about the relative frequency. And if it's
a very short review that says good, 0 times, and bad also 3
times, then it's probably a bad review. So you want to
really scale these so that the relative frequency of the
word only matters and not the total length document. That's
sort of what the normalization does.

And so the common thing to do is L2 normalization, which
divides by Euclidean norm.

# N-grams: Beyond single words
- Bag of words completely removes word order.
- "didn't love" and "love" are very different!

--

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/single_words.png)
]
???
Because there's a big difference between ‘didn't love’ and
‘love’ and the default settings in the count vectorizer
cannot distinguish between the two because somewhere along
the document, it could appear ‘don't’ and you don't know if
it's in front of ‘love’, or if it’s ‘love, don't hate’ or
‘don't love hate’, since they basically have the same
representation.

The idea behind N-grams is you look at pairs of words that
appear next to each other. Unigrams looks at single words,
bigrams look at pairs of two words next to each other, and
trigrams looks at three words next to each other, and so on.


Here instead of splitting it up into single tokens, we can
split it up into pairs of tokens allowing me to have a
little bit of context around each of the words.


- N-grams: tuples of consecutive words

]
???
When implementing in scikit-learn, you have to specify the
N-gram range, which has the minimum number of tokens and the
maximum number of tokens you want to look at.

Usually, you want to look at Unigram + Bigrams + Trigrams,
don't look at only Bigrams. If I only look at Unigrams, I
get a vocabulary of size 8. If I look only at Bigrams, I get
a vocabulary of size 8 as well, that's because this was a
toy example and in the real world there will be much more
Bigrams than Unigrams.

If you look at the result from combining Unigrams and
Bigrams together, we get 16, which is a combination of both
the result.

Now I have a feature representation of size 16, and so I
extended my feature space so that I can take the context
into account.

Unigrams and Bigrams together are the most common
combinations. Using higher order N-grams is rare.



- Typically: higher n-grams lead to blow up of feature space!

```
```
Vocabulary size 1-4gram (min_df=1): 7815528
```


- More than 20x more 4-grams!
???
This is using no stop words.

Now because many bigrams and many trigrams are very
infrequent. So if I use the example of min_df=4 in Unigrams
I get 26928 features while in Bigrams I get 128426 features.
So it grew by nearly the order of magnitude. So I have a
much, much bigger feature space now. If I put it together,
it's even bigger.

The higher I go, the bigger it gets. Though, you can see
that it actually grows relatively slowly here. So if I look
into 1-3grams programs, and 1-4grams, I only get 300,000
features. But this is mostly because I did the min_df=4.
There are very few sequences of 4 words that appear often
together. If I don't use the min_df=4 and I look at all
things I get nearly 8 million features. This is like 20
times more four grams than what we had before.

So particularly if you use higher N-grams using this pruning
of document frequency might be quite helpful. You can see
that probably they have about the same amount of
information, but you’ll have 20 times fewer features, which
will definitely impact runtime and possibly impact
generalization.

#Stop-word impact on bi-grams

cv = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), min_df=4,
                     stop_words="english")
cv.fit(text_train)
print("(1, 2), stopwords, min_df=4: ", len(cv.vocabulary_))
```
```
(1, 2), min_df=4: 155354
(1, 2), stopwords, min_df=4: 81085
```
???
This is with stop words. What we're doing is we do stop
words first and then N-grams. What I find interesting is
that here using unigrams and bigrams we got 155354, but if
we remove the stop words it gets halved to 81085. This is
pretty extreme.

The stop word list is only 200 words. So if we remove these
200 words and if you look at the bigrams we half the number
of bigrams. This is because the most common combinations are
actually we with stop words. So ‘the movie’ and ‘the film’
are probably the most common Bigrams in this.

So if we remove this then whatever word that came before
‘the’ is now makes after bigram. And so now, the
combinations appear much less frequently.

Here are some models using Unigrams, Bigrams, and Trigrams,
with and without stop words. You can see that most of the
most common features are actually Unigrams.

It's interesting because previously ‘worth’ didn't show up
but since we have bigrams, we can distinguish between ‘not
worth’ and ‘well worth’.

You can also see that most of these actually were Bigrams
that included stop word.

It gets slightly worse because all of these Bigrams actually
have stop words in them.




Stopwords removed fares slightly worse

# Character n-grams

The next thing I want to talk about is character n-grams.
Character n-grams are a different way to extract features
from text data. It's not that useful for general text
classification but it's useful for some more specific
applications.

The idea is that, instead of looking at tokens, which are
words, we look at windows of characters.

#Applications

- Be robust to misspelling / obfuscation
- Language detection
- Learn from Names / made-up words
???
This can be helpful to be more robust towards misspelling or
obfuscation. So people might replace a single particular
letter in a word with like internet speak. And so if you use
character n-grams, you can still match if someone used the
same characters for the rest of the word.

You can also use it for language detection. Language
detection, I think by now relatively soft task. But
basically, it's very easy to detect the language, if you
have a text, you can use character n-grams. You can't really
use a bag of words because the words in different languages
are sort of distinct, and you don't actually need to build
vocabularies for all the languages. If you just look at the
n-grams, that's enough to know whether something is English
or French or something.

Also, it helps to learn from names or any made-up words.

One thing that is interesting in a social context is to look
at ethnicity from names. And you can actually get someone's
ethnicity from their last name, and in some cases, also from
their first name.

]
???
To do this with scikit-learn, you can use the count
vectorizer with the analyzer equal char. So instead of word
tokenization, it does character tokenization.

Usually, we look at characters that are longer, so single
characters don’t really tell us much. Here, I look at
n-grams of size 2 and 3. You can also go up to, like 5 or 7,
obviously, the feature space tends to explode if you go
higher.

After applying, I get a vocabulary of size 73, which is
pretty big for such a short text.

And there's also a featurette that can respect word
boundaries called char_wb.

So here, you get the end of one word and the beginning of
the next word, you might want to exclude that if you're only
interested on the actual words. So the char_wb makes sure
that there's no white space inside the character n-gram.

words. But actually, I get a result that is about as good as
the bag of words.

I can also look at the features that are important. The way
this looks like is that it seems pretty redundant. So it
picked up different subparts of the words. So this might not
be ideal, but the accuracy is still good.

Another thing that I found quite interesting when I looked
at this is that some people gave their star rating in the
comment. This is actually leaking the label of the star
rating. This is not something that we saw before but here
looking at his character n-grams, we can see that that's
something that's in the dataset.

I can try to do either with word or character n-gram.

Using an f1 macro, I don’t get a good f1 score. If I use
character n-grams, it's not super great but it's still quite
a lot better than if we look at the words because I don't
need to learn new digital names.

We can do a grid search, though that might take a while on
the bigger dataset.

Things that you want to tune are a regularization of your
models, I always use logistic regression CV to tune it
internally. If I want to tune multiple things at once, I
could use as a pipeline grid search.

Here, this is for character n-grams, but still, I might want
to tune the n-gram range. If I was using bag of words, I
might not look at sequences of 8 words because it will take
very long to compute this and it's probably not going to be
useful.

Here, I'm using count vectorizer, but I could still
normalize using the L2 normalizer.

Another thing, if you do something like this, you don't want
to fit each step of the pipeline every time. So some of
these steps for the count vectorizer, if you have a big
dataset, it might be pretty expensive and so you don't want
to refit this again, just because you're plugged in the
normalizer or just because you changed the C parameter in
the logistic regression.

Make pipeline has a parameter called memory that allows you
to cash the results. So you just have to give it a non-empty
string and it'll use that as the full name to catch the
results. If there's no catch eviction, at some point you
need to delete it, or your hard drive will run full.

Here, you can see that after tuning everything, I actually
get a result that's much better than what I had before. So
before I had an f1 macro of 0.45 and now I have 0.58.

So min_df=2 and ngram_range: (1,5) and c=10 gives the best
results.


- Small dataset, makes grid-search faster! (less reliable)

# Other features
- Length of text
- Number of out-of-vocabularly words
- Presence / frequency of ALL CAPS
- Punctuation...!? (somewhat capturedd by char ngrams)
- Sentiment words (good vs bad)
- Whatever makes sense for the task!
???
There are other kinds of features that you might want to
look into.

There are actual collections of positive-negative words that
you can download and you can check how many positive words
are in this, how many negative words are in this. So
basically, the model can share information about how
important these words are because a particularly positive
word might appear only very infrequently in your dataset but
you can still learn that positive word means good.

Bag of words is a pretty good baseline. It’s a very simple
approach and often gives reasonable results.

# Large Scale Text Vectorization
???
The last thing I want to mention is how you can scale this
up for really large scale stuff.

Basically just a very slight modification. So for example,
if you want to use training a model on the Twitter stream,
which has tweets coming in all the time, this has a couple
of problems.

- You don't want to store all the data

- Your vocabulary might shift over time. You might not be
able to store the whole vocabulary, because the whole
vocabulary of what everybody says on Twitter is very large.

There's a trick which allows you to get away without
building a vocabulary.

---

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/bag_of_words.png)
]
???
This is what we did before. We tokenize the string, split
onto words, build a vocabulary and then built a sparse
matrix representation. Now we can replace this vocabulary
with just a hash function.
---

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/large_scale_text_vec_2.png)
]
???
And we can use any string hash function, that computes half
of the token, then we represent this token just by its hash
number.

Here, I used a hash method. This just hashes to 832,412 and
so this is the number of the feature. Then I can use these
as indices into my sparse matrix encoding. So now I need a
hash function with some upper limits, let's say 1 billion or
something, and as I get a feature vector of length 1
billion. And then I can use these hashes as indices into
this feature vector.

So I don't need to build a vocabulary which is pretty nice.

# Near drop-in replacement
.smallest[
- Careful: Uses l2 normalization by default!
]

.tiny-code[
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer
hv = HashingVectorizer()
X_train = hv.transform(text_train)
X_val = hv.transform(text_val)
```
```python
lr.score(X_val, y_val)
```
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer
hv = HashingVectorizer()
X_train = hv.transform(text_train)
X_val = hv.transform(text_val)
```
```python
X_train.shape
```
```
(18750, 1048576)
```
```python
lr = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(X_train, y_train)
lr.score(X_val, y_val)
```

]
???
This is a drop-in replacement for count vectorizer. It's the
hashing vectorizer. Here, you can see by default, it
actually uses a hash base of about a million.

The result was about the same. It can be faster, and you get
away without storing the vocabulary

# Trade-offs

.left-column[
Pro:
- Fast
- Works for streaming data
- Low memory footprint
]
.right-column[
Con:
- Can't interpret results
- Hard to debug
- (collisions are not a problem for performance)

]
???
Here are pros and cons listed.

It's hard to interpret the results because now you have like
a feature vector of size million, but you don't know what
the features correspond to. Previously we had a vocabulary
and we could say feature 3 corresponds to X and now we don't
know what it is.

You could try to store the correspondences but that would
sort of remove all the benefits. So that makes it kind of
hard to debug.

There can be hash collisions, which make it harder to
interpret. 2 tokens can hash to the same index. In practice,
that's not really a problem for accuracy. But it's a problem
for interpretability because you can't undo the hash
function so you don't know why your model learned the thing
it learned. But if you have really big text data or
streaming setting, this is a quite simple and effective
method.
