today we'll talk about word embeddings
word embeddings are the logical next step in doing text analysis after working
with topic models on Monday.

FIXME: all the bullet points?!
FIXME: redo paragraph vector experiments
FIXME: state of the art?
FIXME: too short?
FIXME: word embeddings with tensorflow?
FIXME for CBOW and skip-gram shared weights for context
FIXME for CBOW, which do we keep?

# Beyond Bags of Words

Limitations of bag of words:
- Semantics of words not captured
- Synonymous words not represented
- Very distributed representation of documents

???

Last time we started talking about limitations of bag of
words, such as semantics of words are not captured
synonymous words are not represented - if I use two
synonymous words, for example film and movie, they are
represented in completely different ways and there is no
connection between them. and we also have a very distributed
representation of documents, which might be hard to
understand or hard to learn from.

# Last Time

- Latent Semantic Analysis
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- All embed documents into a continuous, corpus specific
space.
- Today: Embed words in a “general” space (mostly).

???

Last time we looked at latent semanic analysis, non-negative
matrix factorization and latent dirichlet allocation. Each
of them embedds the documents into a continuous, corpus
specific space of a dimension of our choosing, using an
unsupervised objective. The first two are matrix
factorization, the third is a probabilistic generative
model.

Today we'll be talking about a more general embedding, which
tries to embedd individual words, not documents. The goal is
to learn an embedding that's generally useful, and not
necessarily tied to a particular corpus.

---
class: spacious
# Idea

- Unsupervised extraction of semantics using large
corpus (wikipedia etc)
- Input: one-hot representation of word (as in BoW).
- Use auxiliary task to learn continuous
representation.

???

We'll talk about several methods, but they'll all use a very
large corpus to create a relatively generic embedding. So we
might use something like wikipedia or google news or a big
corpus of books. It's an unsupervised task, but the way it
is phrased is using an auxiliary supervised task to learn
the embedding. And what I mean by that will be more clear
shortly. The starting principle is a one-hot representation
of each word, as in Bag of words, which basically just
means each word is identified by some index.

# Skip-Gram models

- Given a word, predict surrounding word
- Supervised task, each document yields many
examples
- Not interested in performance for this task, just
want to learn representations.

???

A very commonly used auxiliary task is the skip-gram model.
Here the task is, given a word, predict the surrounding
words. This is a supervised task, with each document
providing many examples, basically as many as there are
words in the document. I'm saying this is an auxiliary task,
because we're not really interested in actually solving this
problem of predicting surrounding words, we just want to use
this task to learn useful representations.

# Example
```
[“What is my purpose?”, “You pass the butter.”]
```
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/context_window.png)
]

Using context windows of size 1 (in practice 5 or 10):

???
Here's an example of what this task looks like. Let's say we
have a corpus of two documents, "what is my purpose" and
"you pass the butter". We specify a context window size,
let's say one. Then, for each word that has enough context,
we generate a training example. So for "is", we have a
context of "what" and "my", for "my" we have "is" and
"purpose", and so on. So the input would be "is" and the
goal would be to predict that the word before is "what" and
the word after is "my". that assigns a high probability to
the outputs "what" and "my". In practice larger context
windows are used, often 5-10 words in either direction.
Cearly it's impossible to actually solve this task, because
each word can appear in many different contexts. The goal is
to learn which contexts are likely, and which are not.

---
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/cbow_skipgram_1.png)
]

???
Here’s the architecture that we will be using for this. It's
kind of like neural network only, this is completely linear.
In the left-hand side, we have the input layer with one hot
encoding services in V-dimensional. V represents the size of
vocabulary. And basically, only one of them will be 1 and
the others will be 0.

Then we have a weight matrix connecting it to the
n-dimensional hidden layer. From there, we have multiple
outputs that correspond to the previous word, previous 2
words, and previous 3 words and so on. And then the next
word, next 2 words, next 3 words and so on.

Each output is, again, one hot encoding, which allows you to
predict each possible version of vocabulary. These layers
here are very large in size.

Behind the hidden layer is basically a logistic regression.
So this is just a linear classifier with a softmax
activation. So each of these Ws will try to predict what the
words are before and after.

Basically, you have one hot encoding, you've multiplied with
the first matrix, and then you multiply it with another
matrix and then you do softmax. The reason why you have
these two matrix multiplication is basically you want to
create a bottleneck so if you had a very wide vector, you
could do one matrix multiplication, basically, you want this
matrix to have a lower rank. So you want to compress a
representation to something small.

Each row of W corresponds to a single word. We train this
whole thing in a supervised fashion to minimize the log
loss. But we’re only interested in is getting weights w.

]
???
The problem is you sum over all the outputs. All the outputs
are all the words in the vocabulary. If you have a million
words in your vocabulary, this is going to be a lot of work.


This is a step that you need to do every time when you want
to optimize it. And so what most of the algorithms do is
they just approximate the sum by sampling some words. So it
just normalizes by some words, but not by all words.

This is the model that's most commonly used. This is called
skip grams.

# CBOW vs Skip-gram

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cbow_skipgram.png)

.smallest[
Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf
]
???

This is the skip-gram model, here you can see it on the left
(FIXME?!) So we start with the one-hot-encoding of the word,
and we have a matrix multiplication into a latent space. A
matrix multiplication with a one-hot vector just means that
each row in that embedding matrix represents one word. From
this latent space, we run logistic regression, trying to
predict what the word is for each particular offset, so here
in this picture we're trying to predict the word two to the
left, one to the left, one to the right, and two to the
right. So these are basically four classifiers running on
the same input.

Another approach is shown on the left, the continuous bag of
words model, or CBOW. This is something that seems a bit
more natural to me, where given the context, we are trying
to predict the word in the center. So here we would be given
four context words and try to figure out what's the most
likely word to be in between those.

The skip grams work better. CBOW might capture some things
like synonymous words because I can switch the synonyms word
for another word, and it’ll still make sense in the same
context. So if I say, I watched a movie or I watched the
film, it doesn't really matter.

---
# Implementations

- Gensim
- Word2vec
- Tensorflow
- Don't train yourself

???
Word2vec uses both the skip grams and continues bag of
words.

You can train this using TensorFlow. If you actually want to
train it yourself, it's probably the best idea because then
you can do it on GPU. These are usually like large matrices,
you have a large corpus which will take forever. With
TensorFlow, you can do it on a GPU and, and it makes things
much more bearable.

But generally, just don't train it yourself. You can
download several of these word2vec models from Google, for
example.

# Gensim - topic models for humans

- Multiple Latent Dirichlet Allocation implementations
- Wrappers for Mallet and vopal wabbit
- Tools for analyzing topic models
- No supervised learning
- Uses list-of-tuples instead of sparse matrices to
store documents.

???
Gensim is a Python library for text analysis. Gensim is very
easy to use and it has a lot of features. Last time, I
mentioned spacy and NLTK as libraries for NLP, Gensim is the
third one in that list which is very specific to topic
models. And it has multiple implementations of LDA. It has
wrappers for Mallet and vowpal wabbit, which also has very
fast on LDA implementation. It has no supervised learning.
This is all about document retrieval and feature extraction.


The main thing to keep in mind when you work with this and
when you combine this with scikit-learn is that it uses a
list of tuples to store documents instead of sparse
matrices. It's completely equivalent. It's just a different
data structure. But if you want to mix this with
scikit-learn, you need to make sure to convert it.

Use NLTK or spacy or a regexp for tokenization in real
applications. This method here doesn’t even handle
punctuation.
In gensim, a document is represented as list of tuples
(index, frequency), corpus is a list of these.

They yield a generator (like Sparse2Corpus) which can
be converted to a list.

```
```

```
```python
w.vectors.shape
```
```
(3000000, 300)
```
???
There are 2 benefits to using these prebuilt models.
A)  It takes a long time to run to train these
B) You probably don't have the corpus, you can download
Wikipedia, but I don't think you can actually download the
Google News corpus.

There are 3,000,000 word vectors in total stored in this
model. So there’s a vocabulary of size 3,000,000. Each of
the words in the vocabulary has a 300-dimensional vector.

I can only apply this to words that are within this
vocabulary. If I have any words that are not in this
vocabulary, then this model is useless.

The first thing that we want to do is to check whether these
representations actually semantic in some way. To do this,
first, we need to define how can we measure similarity in
this space. And the way that similarities usually measured
between words is using the cosine similarity.

---
# Cosine Similarity
.padding-top[

`$$\Large \text{similarity}(v, w)=\cos(\theta) = \frac{v^Tw}{\lVert v\rVert \lVert w \rVert}$$`
]
???
This is quite related to Euclidean distance but basically,
it normalizes the weight, the length of the vector. This is
a set of a distance matrix that’s very commonly used in NLP.
For example, if you want to compare if the two documents are
similar. For documents in the bag of words representation,
this might be quite intuitive, since it just sort of
normalizes the length of document away.

# Inspecting Semantics

w.most_similar(positive=['movie'], topn=5)
```

```
[('film', 0.8676770925521851),

 ('moive', 0.6830361485481262),
 ('Movie', 0.6693680286407471)]
```
???
Now that we know how we can measure similarities in the
space, we can find similar words. And so let's start with
‘movie’ and the top 5 matches for it (ordered from most
similar to least similar top 5)

This computes the cosine similarities between the
300-dimensional vector for movie and all the other
300-dimensional vectors for the 3 million other words and
gives the 5 closest one. In this case, they are ‘film’,
‘movies’, ‘films’, ‘moive’, ‘Movie’. I guess ‘moive’ is a
common misspelling.

---
```python
w.most_similar(positive=['good'], topn=5)
```
???
Trying the same for the word ‘good’ gives ‘great’, ‘bad’,
‘terrific’, ‘decent’ and ‘nice’. ‘bad’ is an antonym not a
synonym for ‘good’, this makes sense since sometimes if we
replace ‘good’ with ‘bad’, it will still make sense.

Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin
(pardon the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms
of revenge movies. Not only did I find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy
towards the "screwee", I felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a
rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscant of
"Hellraiser", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy handed piece that does not offer
the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile. This piece brings it and
doesn't appologize.
I liked this one a lot. Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.

???
This is a silly way to tokenize the input and using only
words that appear in the vocabulary used in the pretrained
model.

Doing the same for movie review. I’m tokenizing this in a
way that only the words that appear in the vocabulary are
actually here because the other words can’t be encoded in
Word2vec. So I get the count vectorizer, I use the
vocabulary in the Word2vec model and then I transform and
inverse transform and I get these results where each of them
has a 300-dimensional vector


So now we have the list of tokens for all the movie reviews.
And the most common way to use this to represent documents
is just using the average.

```

```python
lr_w2v.score(X_val, y_val)

```
0.857

]
???
Right now, each of the tokens is replaced by a
300-dimensional vector. And so I can represent each review
by the mean of all the 300-dimensional vectors of the words.

So previously, I had 18750 lists of 300-dimensional vectors
for the training dataset and now I only have one
300-dimensional vector.

After computing, we can see that we didn't really gain a
lot, but definitely, there's still a lot of information
available to do the sentiment analysis. I think it's better
than using LSA or LDA.

This still has some downsides of the bag of words in that
you discard to word order.

You can actually also do embedding for bigrams and trigrams.


One of the thing that people found, which was quite
interesting is that you can actually do some sort of
semantic algebra with it.

You can use these vectors to find relationships. So people
found that if they look at the difference between men, and
women, it looks very similar to the difference between uncle
and aunt or king and queen. They also found that, for
example, the difference between King and kings is the same
as between queen and Queens.

If you want to ask a question, what is to Queen as kings are
to King?

You can take vector representation of Queen and add the
vector representation of kings, and subtract the vector
representation of King. And if you look at the closest point
to that, you'll find it's going to be queens. People did
this with a lot of different sort of semantic pairs.

One thing that's quite interesting is people embedded
countries and their capitals using a 300-dimensional space

basically the same that goes from Japan to Tokyo. You can

based on cbow, not skip-grams

Add a vector for each paragraph / document, also
randomly initialized.
To infer for new paragraph: keep weights fixed, do
stochastic gradient descent on the representation D,
sampling context examples from this paragraph.

FIXME better explanation.

There is no gradient descent at encoding time for word2vec!


The most common approach here is Doc2vec.

This here on the right-hand side would be the continuous bag
of word model where you get the context, and where you want
to predict the word from the context. What paragraph vector
now does is it adds in another thing, which is a paragraph
specific ID. It’s basically like adding a unique word to a
vocabulary that’s just unique to this paragraph and encodes
its presence in this paragraph. And you do not only learn
the embedding of all the words, but you also learn embedding
for each paragraph. And so basically, this tries to make up
for what the words cannot predict. So you have the standard
CBOW in the middle layer that tries to make a prediction but
then basically trying to correct this prediction by having a
paragraph specific ID. This maybe not sorts of the most
intuitive way. But it actually seemed to work quite well.
This is actually in practice quite a bit trickier than just
looking at the word vectors since how are you going to do
this if you get a new document?

If you get a new document for the word vectors, you just
look for each word, if it's not in the vocabulary you’re
lost out anyway, if it’s in the vocabulary, you can just
take the vector for this word that you have computed
already.

If you get a new paragraph, how do you get the paragraph
vector?

Since you have a new paragraph that has never seen before,
the paragraph is not in the training set. And so what you do
then you look at the paragraph and you sample training
samples from this paragraph, so your sample context and
words. And you fix all the word vectors because you learned
them on the training sets. You're basically learning this
paragraph ID by doing gradient descent. So you initialize
this paragraph vector randomly and to transform a new
paragraph, you basically learn the paragraph vector for this
paragraph, fixing all the word vectors.

In this sense, it’s more of trying to correct what the model
could not figure out with the word vectors. So now, you have
a vector that represents everything in the paragraph that
was not already encoded in the context, or it might encode
like in a wider context or something like that.

And usually, it's just the same dimensionality as the other
vectors. So here, we would get like a 300-dimensional vector
that encodes each paragraph. But to encode a new paragraph
you need to do gradient descent.

fixme example of nearest neighbors to see if this learned
something useful!
Should use the unlabeled reviews!

So here, basically, I started completely fresh from no model
at all. And I learned embedding for all of the words and for
all the paragraphs. So I did a small validation to see if
the word vectors that I learned are meaningful.

I looked at the most similar ones to ‘movie’ and we get
these results.

I like this better than the ones from the pre-built one.
These are pretty good but it's maybe not as surprising as
‘movie’ is sort of the most common word in the whole corpus.

???
Now I can encode my training corpus.  I get a 50-dimensional
vector for each movie review in the training dataset. If I
want to do classification I can run a logistic regression on
this vector.

So model.infer_vector does the gradient descent to compute
the paragraph vectors for each document.

In the paper, they used much more data from the same corpus
and they used 400-dimensions and probably they also iterated
longer. In the paper, they didn't train a logistic
regression on this. They trained a neural network on this,
this probably makes a difference

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
lr = LogisticRegression(C=100).fit(X_train, y_train_sub)

lr.score(X_train, y_train_sub)
```
```

```
```python
lr.score(X_val, y_val)
```
```
0.803

???
Not working well here. Either not enough training data,
sgd didn’t converge yet, or too low dimension.
FIXME combine with word vectors?
In the paper: they actually get 0.926%
400 dimensions (And using unsupervised data)

# GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation


$X_{ij}$ = How often does work j appear in context of word i

`$$ J = \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{V} f(X_{ij}) (w_i^T \tilde{w_j} + b_i + \tilde{b_j} - \log X_{ij})^2$$`


`$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  (x/x_\text{max})^\alpha & \text{if  } x < x_\text{max}  \\
  1 & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}

???

Here X_ij is the coocurrance count matrix, counting
how often word I and j appear in the same context –
say a 5 word window.
We are learning a factorization of log(X_ij) into w_i and
~w_j, where w_i are the word-vectors we want to
extract.
Very infrequent word-pairs are less important to get
right, and are down-weighted using f(X_ij).

alpha is 3/4 empirically. x_max is 100.

# GloVe  Weighting function f

![:scale 90%](images/glove_weighting.png)
???
If you're larger than X max, it's just weighted by 1. If all
words appear at least 100 times then the loss is weighted
fully and if words appear less than 100 times, then you take
x divided by 100 to the power of alpha, and they found alpha
equal to 0.75. So it works better than linear.

So in the beginning, you have to compute this big sparse
matrix once, but then you can do gradient descent just on
this given statistics.

The last thing I want to talk about today is Stochastic

linear models or neural networks. But it's good to

# Decomposing Generalization Error

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_13.png)

Bottou et. al.

???
The idea here is that if you have a lot of data, maybe
solving the problem exactly isn't as important as looking at
all of the data. Let's say I want to find a good function
that generalizes well over to test dataset and I have a
budget of how many data points I can look at it and I want
to approximate the best possible function on the training
set with an accuracy of epsilon. What we want is a model of
generalized as well, what we do in practice is we pick a
family of functions, like the linear functions, we estimate
the best function using the training set, we want one that's
the best on the true distribution, but instead we're using
the training set and then we need to have some numeric
optimization procedure that optimizes it until the error is
smaller than epsilon for whatever loss, the loss could be
regularized or anything but still we need to minimize
optimization problem to some precision and we can only use
at most as much data points as their dataset. And we've only
a particular budget of time that it can use. So these are
sort of the restrictions we have. And we want to find the
best model.

---
class: center, middle

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_14.png)
]

???
So now let's look at what happens to these three errors in
the time if we increase different parts. If we make the
family of functions bigger, so let's say we use from linear
function to neural networks or we go to a high dimensional
space, the approximation error, that’s the error that we get
by restricting ourselves to do class goes down because we
have a richer class. The estimation error which means the
error we get by using the training set, instead of having
access to the true distribution gets larger because we have
more flexibility in our model, so the distance between what
the ideal will be on the true distribution and the training
data set becomes bigger. And if we have a larger family of
functions obviously it's going to take longer. If you have
more data points, the estimation error will go down. So our
optimization will be closer to what is the true
distribution, but it will take more time. The final row
represents the precision to which I want to optimize, the
epsilon in which I want to stop optimizing the problem that
I'm optimizing. The optimization error will go up, but the
time will go down. It's faster if I optimize less strongly.

# The Trade-off

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_math_1.png)
]
- If `$n_\text{max}$` is large, we are constraint by $T_\max$!
- Use a worse algorithm but look at more data!


???
If the number of data points is really large, the thing that
we really constraint is by the runtime.  If constrained by
the runtime, can't we just subsample the data? Yes, you
could. Then you would run faster. But the point that he's
making is it's better to look at all of the data and so
we're decreasing estimation error but we don't find a
precise solution. So now we say it's more important to
minimize the estimation error, which we can do by looking at
a lot of data than actually optimizing it very precisely
because the thing that we are optimizing is a training set
error, which is not really the thing that we're interested
in the first place. So we look at the algorithm that does
worst in terms of optimization, but it's much faster. This
is the algorithm that’s most commonly used and the algorithm
is Stochastic Gradient Descent.

# Reminder: Gradient Descent

.right-column[![:scale 1-0%](images/img_15.png)]

Want: $$\arg \min_w F(w)$$

Initialize $w_0$

$$w^{(i+1)} \leftarrow w^{(i)} - \eta_i\frac{d}{dw}F(w^{(i)})$$

Converges to local minimum

???
First, let's talk about Gradient Descent. So we have some
function we want to minimize here the function is Lasso
training data set plus the regularizer. F is the objective
of the model and I want to find the best parameter setting
w. The way gradient descent works are that we initialize it
with some W and then we compute a gradient then we walk down
the gradient by a small step. This converges to a local
minimum in the function. For linear models, there's only one
global minimum. Basically, any optimization algorithm you
can think of will always converge to the same solution, they
only converge at different speeds.

# Reminder: Gradient Descent

$$w^{(i+1)} \leftarrow w^{(i)} - \eta_i\frac{d}{dw}F(w^{(i)})$$

???
A little bit of an issue here is picking a learning rate
which is how big a step are you making. If you make too
small a step, then you're going to get stuck wherever you're
started. If you pick the right step size, you can make very
quick progress. If you pick too a big step size, you're
going to be missing the target and just jumping around the
target. This is a very simple optimizer. But it's not great
and it’s not very fast because you need to compute gradients
over the whole dataset. What you can do instead is you can
approximate a gradient by looking only a single data point
at a time.

# Batch vs stochastic optimization

<br />

--

Minibatch
`$$ W_i \leftarrow W_i - \eta\sum\limits_{j=k}^{k+m} \frac{\partial l(x_j,y_j)}{\partial W_i}$$`


???
So doing standard gradient descent, we would update a weight
matrix W_i but using the old W_i and taking a gradient step,
so subtracting the gradient of the loss wrt the paramters,
summed over the whole training set, times some learning
rate. The problem with this is that it's quite slow.
Computing all these gradients means that we need to pass all
the examples forward through the network, make predictions,
and then do a backward pass with backpropagation. That's a
lot of matrix multiplications to do a single gradient step,
in particular given that we want to do this for very large
datasets. So what we can do to speed this up is doing a
stochastic approximation, as we already saw for linear
models, doing stochastic gradient descent aka online
gradient descent. Here, you pick a sample at random, compute
the gradient just considering that sample, and then update
the parameter. So you update the weights much more often,
but you have a much less stable estimate of the gradient. In
practice, we often just iterate through the data instead of
picking a sample at random. And as with linear models, this
is much faster than doing full batches for large datasets.

However, it's less stable, and also it doesn't necessarily
use the hardware in the best way. So we can do a compromise
in where we look at mini-batches of size k, usually
something like 64 or 512. So we look at k samples, compute
the gradients, average them, and update the weights. That
allows us to update much more often than looking at the
whole dataset, while still having a more stable gradient,
and better being able to use the parallel computing
capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs. This is what's used in
practice basically always. The reason why this is faster is
basically that doing a matrix-matrix multiplication is
faster than doing a bunch of matrix-vector operations.

In principle we could also be using smarter optimization
methods, like second order methods or LBFGS, but these are
often not very effective on these large non-convex problems.
One, called levenberg-marquardt is actually a possibility,
but it's not really used these days.

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Logistic Regression:

`$$F(w) = -C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + ||w||_2^2$$`


- Pick $x_i$ randomly, then

`$$\frac{d}{dw}F(w) = \frac{d}{dw} -C \log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + \frac{1}{n}||w||_2^2$$`

- In practice: just iterate over i.


???
Looking at the Logistic Regression, the functional Logistic
Regression we want to minimize is the log loss plus the
regularizer. Instead of looking at the gradient for the
whole sum here, we can get a stochastic approximation of the
gradient by looking at only one of the sums at a time. In
practice, we iterate over the dataset and go one by one
through all the data points. We make sure we shuffle them
before. Then we do small gradient steps. This is a very bad
optimizer compared to the SAG but it can go very quickly
over a lot of data.

# SGD and partial_fit

- SGDClassifier(), SGDRegressor() fast on very large datasets
- Tuning learning rate and schedule can be tricky.
- partial_fit allows working with out-of-memory data!


???
This is implemented in SGD classifier, and SGD regressor and
you can use it in very large data sets. It's a little bit
tricky to tune the learning rate and so you can either pick
as constant learning rate, or you can pick an exponentially
decreasing learning rate. There's one that's called optimal.
If you scale your data to standard division 1, then the
optimal one will often work well but it's not actually
optimal on any sense. This will allow you to give you
something quickly on a big data set. There's also another
thing you can do, there's a method called partial_fit that
these models have which allows you to iteratively fit feed
it data. If you have like streaming data coming in and you
having infinite data, you can just keep giving it more and
more data called partial_fit. This method will update the
model. In scikit-learn, if you call fit multiple times it
will always forget whatever it saw before. Each fit resets
the model while partial fit will remember what it saw before
and keeps fitting the model. SGDClassifier() and
SGDRegressor both have a whole bunch of different loss
function penalties so they both can do elastic net penalty
and the classifier can do logistic loss and hinge loss and
squared hinge loss and the regressor can do Huber loss and
squared error and absolute error. So there are many, many
different choices for different loss functions.

![:scale 90%](images/img_19.png)



???
Fit works just like everywhere else. Partial fit you can
call it with different batches of data and this will keep
fitting the model. One thing that you should keep in mind
for the classifier is that you need to give it the classes
at the beginning because it doesn't know how many classes
there are and at the first time, not all the classes might
be present in the data you give it to. So you need to
specify how many classes there are. Partial fit doesn't do
loops over a dataset. So if you want to use a partial fit,
and you want to loop over dataset multiple times, you have
to set the loop yourself. If you loop over a dataset, if you
do more of gradient descent, then you get better results.
This code is the same code for all combinations of losses
and regularizers because it’s very simple to write this
down.
