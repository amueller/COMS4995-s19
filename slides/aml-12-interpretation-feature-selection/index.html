# Model Interpretation and Feature Selection

03/06/18

Andreas C. Müller

???
Alright, everybody. Today we will talk about
Feature selection and model interpretation, look at how to do this in general,
and how to doit with scikit-learn. We're also going to look into a couple
of other Python libraries that help doing these two things.



FIXME random forest code is confusing because I tried to
simplify it. Also: we haven't seen those yet?!

FIXME mutual information needs better explanation
FIXME lasso show random between correlated, same for tree, compare to RF
FIXME IceBOX example with cross?

# Model Interpretation (post-hoc)?

- ## Not inference!
- ## Not causality!
- ## still useful(?)

???
Possibly useful for feature selection, feature engineering, model debugging, explaining predictions.
Alternatively: use model that are easy to interpret!
OR: derive a simpler explainable model from a non-explainable one (model compression)

Caveat: if your model is bad, interpreting it makes no sense!

---
# Types of explanations

## Explain "kind of model"
- How would the model change if this feature was dropped?
- Doesn't explain this particular fitted model

##Explain model globally
- How does the output depend on the input?
- Often: some form of marginals


## Explain model locally
- Why did it classify this point this way?
- Explanation could look like a "global" one but be different for each point.
- "What is the minimum change to classify it differently?"

???
Marginals: how does the prediction change as function of a particular Features?
---
# "Features important to the model"?

Naive:
- `coef_` for linear models (abs value or norm for multi-class)
- `feature_importances_` for tree-based models 

Use with care!
---
# Drop Feature Importance

```python
def drop_feature_importance(est, X, y):
    base_score = np.mean(cross_val_score(est, X, y, cv=5))
    scores = []
    for feature in range(X.shape[1]):
        mask = np.ones(X.shape[1], 'bool')
        mask[feature] = False
        X_new = X[:, mask]
        this_score = np.mean(cross_val_score(est, X_new, y, cv=5))
        scores.append(base_score - this_score)
    return np.array(scores)
```
- Can't deal with correlated features well
- Very slow
???
on it's own not very useful, we'll see it later
rebuilds many models, not explaining this particular model!
---
# Permutation importance
Idea: measure marginal influence of one feature

```python
def permutation_importance(est, X, y, n_bootstrap=100):
  baseline_score = estimator.score(X, y)
  for f_idx in range(X.shape[1]):
      for b_idx in range(n_bootstrap):
          X_new = X.copy()
          X_new[:, f_idx] = np.random.shuffle(X[:, f_idx])
          feature_score = estimator.score(X_new, y)
          scores[f_idx, b_idx] = baseline_score - feature_score
```

# Partial Dependence Plots
- Marginal dependence of prediction on one or two features

.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence import plot_partial_dependence
boston = load_boston()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    boston.data, boston.target,random_state=0)

gbrt = GradientBoostingRegressor().fit(X_train, y_train)

fig, axs = plot_partial_dependence(
    gbrt, X_train, np.argsort(gbrt.feature_importances_)[-6:],
    feature_names=boston.feature_names, n_jobs=3,
    grid_resolution=50)
```
]

???
But there's also something else that's quite interesting,
which is called Partial Dependence Plots that's actually
possible for all trees. Unfortunately, in scikit-learn, it’s
available only for the gradient boosting. So the idea here
is to not only see what parameters are important but how
will they influence the target. And so after you fit your
model, I'm using the Boston data set to the gradient
boosting regressor, there's a thing called plot partial
dependence, which gets the model and the training data set
and then the features for which I want to make the partial
dependence plots.

So here, I'm looking at the six most important features. The
feature importance is important according to the trees. So I
sort this and take the six most important ones. 

---
# Partial Dependence Plots

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/feat_impo_part_dep.png)
]

???
And so this is what the partner dependence plots look like.
So this is the most important feature, the second most
important feature and so on. This is sort of the marginal
contribution of each feature. Basically, in each tree,
you're summing out the contribution of all the other
features, and you look only at what is the contribution of
this particular feature. In general, this would be hard to
compute. For tree-based models you can compute is a very
efficient way because you can basically just sum up over the
whole space by traversing the tree. 

Here with increased room size, the price increases and you
can see how it increases and you can see that there's like a
big step function here. And you can see that for increased
LSTAT, the price decreases. For the others, there aren’t any
drastic effect. There seems to be some threshold for NOX.
And something funky going on DIS. 

The question is, so I said for random forest, you can't find
out the direction of which way the feature influences. But
that was for the feature importance. So the feature
importance tells the impurity decrease. So here I also look
at the feature importance and they're just numbers so they
don't give you the direction. For both gradient boosting and
random forest, you can look at partial dependency plot, and
they will give you a non-parametric model of how a single
feature influences it. Unfortunately, it’s not available in
scikit-learn. You could do the same thing for random
forests. Because in the end, the way they predict is quite
similar.
---
# Partial Dependence
- Idea: Get marginal predictions given feature.
- How? "integrate out" other features using validation data
- Fast methods available for trees!
- Nonsensical for linear models.
- sklearn master: only gradient boosting
- Next sklearn: fast for gradient boosting, slow for everything else
- future: fast for all tree-based models

---
# Bivariate Partial Dependence Plots
.smaller[
```python
plot_partial_dependence(
    gbrt, X_train, [np.argsort(gbrt.feature_importances_)[-2:]],
    feature_names=boston.feature_names, n_jobs=3, grid_resolution=50)
```
]
.center[
![:scale 80%](images/feature_importance.png)
]

???
You can also do this in bivariate. So here, looking at the
two most important features in a bivariate plot, I'm
actually not giving it a list of features, but I'm giving it
a list of list of features. And so the two most important
features, LSTAT, and ROOM. 

You can see there’s no very complex interaction. As you can
see, the effect of these two features taking into account
all the other features. 

This is something you can usually do for linear model
easily. If you do this for the linear model, you would have
lines everywhere but for more complicated models this is
very hard to do. Way more tricky to do in neural networks.

# Partial Dependence for Classification
.tiny-code[
```python
from sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence import plot_partial_dependence
for i in range(3):
    fig, axs = plot_partial_dependence(gbrt, X_train, range(4), n_cols=4,
                                       feature_names=iris.feature_names, grid_resolution=50, label=i)
```
]
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/feat_impo_part_dep_class.png)
]
???
We can do the same for classification. Here is a partial
dependency plot for the iris dataset. 

As I said, for classification we’re usually using One Versus
Rest. So here, we have three classifiers.

One classifier for sertosa, one for Versicolor and one for
virginica.

You can see that for the first two features they're like
flat. But for sertosa the decision function is high for
small part petal length, medium peddling for versicolor and
large for virginca. These are all put through logistic
function and then normalized.

# Feature Selection

???
Alright, so let's talk about automatic feature selection. I
want to talk about what methods are there to determine what
features are important for your dataset, what features are
important for a particular model. 
---

class: spacious

# Why Select Features?

- Avoid overfitting (?)
- Faster prediction and training
- Less storage for model and dataset
- More interpretable model

???
There's a couple of reasons why you might want to feature
selection. One is to avoid overfitting and get a better
model. In practice, I have rarely seen that happen. It's not
usually what I would try to do to increase performance. If
I’m only interested in performance I probably would not try
to do automatic feature selection unless I think only a very
small subset of my feature is actually important. There's a
lot of increasing performance just by selecting only
important features. 

What I think is more commonly, the reason to do automatic
feature selection is you want to shrink your model to make
faster predictions, to train your model faster, to store
fewer data and possibly to collect fewer data. If you're
collecting the data or to feature from some online process,
maybe it means you need fewer features, you need to store
less information. I think actually the top reason to do
feature selection is to have a more interpretable model. If
your model is smaller, if your model has 5 features instead
of 500, it's probably much easier for you to grasp what the
model does. If you can have a model that is as good with way
fewer features, it will be much easier to explain and most
people will be happy with it.

# Types of Feature Selection

- Unsupervised vs Supervised
- Univariate vs Multivariate
- Model based or not

???
There's a couple of different types of feature selection
that I want to talk about. You can have supervised and
unsupervised feature selection. Depending on whether you
consider the target or not. You can have Univariate versus
Multivariate feature selection. Whereas Univariate looks at
each feature at a time and determines if it’s important.
Multivariate looks at interactions as well. And you can have
a feature selection based on a particular machine learning
model or not. 
---
class: spacious

# Unsupervised Feature Selection

- May discard important information
- Variance-based: 0 variance or few unique values
- Covariance-based: remove correlated features
- PCA: remove linear subspaces

???
So the simpler thing that you might try is to do
unsupervised feature selection which means just discard some
features based on the statistics. For example, you could
remove features that are mostly constant or that have zero
variance. Like if they're always constant, then definitely
they're not going to help you and you can remove them. If
they have very small variance, on the other hand, that might
only mean the scale of the features is small and you should
just re-scale the feature. So just because it has a small
variance, it doesn't really mean anything. People often
discard covariance features. But maybe just the difference
between these two correlated features was the thing that's
important for prediction. If you use any unsupervised
method, then you don't know what are the things that are
actually important are. Similarly, with PCA, it’s not really
feature selection, because it doesn't select subsets of the
original feature. PCA will always use all original features.
But it will remove linear subspaces of the feature space.
And again, a lot of people like this to reduce the
dimensionality and you will get the same things like a
smaller model, maybe not more interpretable. It might be
that the information you discarded is just the information
that's important. In a covariance sense, just because the
data doesn't extend a lot in a particular direction doesn't
mean that this direction isn't the most important one for
your prediction problem.


---

# Covariance

.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale

boston = load_boston()
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
X_train_scaled = scale(X_train)

cov = np.cov(X_train_scaled, rowvar=False)
```
]
.center[
![:scale 32%](images/img_17.png)
]

???
Here's what the covariance matrix looks like for the Boston
housing data set. The way you could do covariance based
feature selection is you look at the features that have the
highest covariance and just drop one of them or you could
sum over all the features and look at which features most
correlated with the other ones and drop that.
---

```python
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy
order = np.array(hierarchy.dendrogram(
    hierarchy.ward(cov),no_plot=True)['ivl'], dtype="int")
```

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/img_19.png)
]

???

So if you look at covariance, it should probably try to sort
your features using some clustering. Here I'm using
hierarchical clustering from scipy. On the right, it’s the
covariance matrix and on the left, it's also the covariance
matrix where I reordered the columns and rows. You can see
that there are three correlated blocks. You could do this
automatically, or you could look at it and see what you
think how many features are there, and how many of them are
correlated. I really urge you, whenever you look at
correlation, never look at correlation without resorting the
columns. On the right-hand side here, maybe I can see that
these two are correlated, but I can't see anything else.
Whereas on the left hand I can see much more clearly what
the structure of the data is. What it did just was, it did
clustering on the rows and columns to resort them.

# Univariate Statistics

.smaller[
- Pick statistic, check p-values !
- f_regression, f_classsif, chi2 in scikit-learn
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression
f_values, p_values = f_regression(X, y)
```
]
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/img_20.png)
]

???
So the simplest way is univariate features selection without
models. The most classical one is to use statistical test
and see the ones that are significantly related to the
target. Depending on whether you look through classification
or regression, you can add a t-test, f-test or chi-squared
test and you can say which are the features that are
significantly related with a target and I'm just going to
select these. 

So this is again here for the Boston housing dataset, using
F regression and F test. You can see here F values and the P
values and you could use either of them to select a subset
of the features. So for example, the number of rooms and
LSTAT had very high F values, very small P values. These are
certainly the most important features. While this one here
doesn't seem very important. One reason why this is not very
important is because this is the binary variable and so this
assumes linear regression model and the linear regression
model is not very good at exploiting the binary variable.

This is a super quick test to do. It's very fast, it's
probably something you want to look at. But it assumes a
linear model, which you might not want to assume.

```
0.624
]

???
If you want to use these univariate statistics in
scikit-learn there’s a couple of tools to select features
based on this. In feature selection, there's a whole bunch
of them. There select k best which selects the K best
feature, you can specify the number of features you want.
Select percentile, which selects a percentile that you want
and then there's select FPR, it controls for the false
positive rate, it basically does the multiple hypothesis
testing adjustments to make sure that you false discovery
rate of thinking the features are significantly important is
low. These are scikit-learn transformers, you can
instantiate them. By default, the parameter they all use a
score function for classification. So if you want to do
regression, you need to set the score function to F
regression because you need different tests for regression
classification. I said linear regression is not for binary
features, maybe I shouldn't have formulated in that way.
Linear regression doesn't allow you to do interactions,
which is if you have multiple binary features would be the
only issue. It's more sort of that this linear test will not
put a lot of emphasis on a binary feature because the way
the test works. I can obviously also put this in a pipeline.
Here, I’ve used a centered scale for ridge in a pipeline for
a Boston housing data set and here, I’ve used two best
features. You can see it actually got much worse because two
features are not enough to select or to express all the
information.

---

# Mututal Information

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression
scores = mutual_info_regression(X_train, y_train,
                                discrete_features=[3])
```
.center[
![:scale 90%](images/img_22.png)
]

???

Another univariate statistics that you can use which is a
little bit more complicated, which is called Mutual
Information. There's a version for regression classification
in scikit-learn. This doesn't use a linear model. It uses a
non-parametric model using nearest neighbors. So basically,
this also works if the interaction is nonlinear and it works
on discrete and continuous features, but you have to tell us
which features are discrete. So here, in this case, I tell
it the feature number three is discrete and then this gives
me some scores telling me what's the mutual information
between this feature in the target. Here I'm comparing the F
values off the standard regression tests with the mutual
information and they are sort of similar, but not entirely.
If you think there are nonlinear interactions, and you have
a model that can capture nonlinear interactions, then doing
feature selection like taking these nonlinear features into
account is good. This is much more computationally intensive
than doing the F statistics. But this is still Univariate,
looking at one feature at a time.

#Model-Based Feature Selection

- Get best fit for a particular model
- Ideally: exhaustive search over all possible
combinations
- Exhaustive is infeasible (and has multiple testing
issues)
- Use heuristics in practice.

???
So now let's look at multiple features at a time. Most of
the things that look at multiple features at a time are
model-based. Usually, model-based feature selection finds
the subset of features on which this model performs best. So
giving them a particular model like a linear model, or
random forest, I want to find a subset of features for which
this model performs best in terms of cross-validation
performance. Ideally, to do that, I would do an exhaustive
search over all possible subsets of the features. But that's
like exponentially many. Also, if I do so many models fits I
might overfit. So instead, there are several heuristics you
can use to basically shrink or grow the sets of features
that you're using. 

So first you fix the model. For models that give you some
measure of feature importance, there's a very simple
technique which just looks at how important the models
feature is.

# Model based (single fit)

Using, say, a linear model, you fit the single model, and
you discard all the features that the model doesn't think
are important. So this works for linear models really well
and for tree-based models. This allows you to take linear
interactions into account and with trees it allows you to
take arbitrary interactions into account. So for example, I
can use lasso, I can fit the lasso on my model, and I can
look at the coefficients and the things that have small
coefficients are less important in some sense, and so I
could discard some of them. Here again, I plot the F values
versus the coefficients of lasso. For example, here you can
see for this variable, Lasso thinks its way less important
than Univariate selection. Maybe because it was explained
already by a combination of the other features. So if you
have very co-related features Univariate selection will give
all of them the same importance whereas lasso will usually
pick only one of them. If you have many co-related features
lasso picks only one of them at random. So it doesn't mean
that other features are not important. Question is what does
this purple don't represent? It represents that both the
points are overlapping entirely. 
	
Here I use lassoCV which means it adjusted the
regularization parameter in Lasso to make the optimum
predictions.

# Changing Lasso alpha

If I look at the different alpha, it might be quite
different. For example here with a default alpha of one, a
lot of the coefficients are exactly zero and you can see it
would only select five. How to select the alpha in lasso is
important for the feature selection and so you might want to
grid search. Now, let’s say we want to use this and so we
want a scikit-learn estimator that does this. So we can put
it in a pipeline.

```
```

```

???
SelectFrom model will work with any model with coef_ or feature_importances_.
So that’s any linear model or tree based model. It uses this to
select the features. So this will fit lasso and then if you
call transform, it will discard all the features that lasso
thought are not important. And you can change the threshold
here, for example, so in this case, here I want to discard
everything that lasso put to zero so I put a very small
threshold in there. I could also set the threshold to be the
median which selects 50% of the features. Here we are
possibly discarding multiple features at once.
SelectFromModel fits a single model, gets the feature
importance was from this model and then drops according to
the feature importance. And so here is how it looks in the
pipeline, for example, you can see here that lasso with
these parameters, drop two of the features and 11 after 13
remains. If I put it in a pipeline the performance is about
the same.

# Iterative Model-Based Selection

- Fit model, find least important feature, remove, iterate.
- Or: Start with single feature, find most important feature, add, iterate.

???
But maybe dropping multiple features at once is not a good
idea because the importance of the features might change
once we dropped some of them. What we can do is, we can
iteratively build models. And we could either start with a
single feature then add more important ones or we could
start with all features and discard some. 

We'll talk about these two strategies which are slightly
different.

# Recursive Feature Elimination

- Uses feature importances / coefficients, similar to “SelectFromModel”
- Iteratively removes features (one by one or in groups)
- Runtime: (n_features - n_feature_to_keep) / stepsize

???
So the next step from what we just saw would be recursive
feature elimination. So if we use SelectFromModel it will
drop all the unimportant features at once, in a recursive
feature elimination usually drops one feature at a time or
as a parameter step size it drops step size features at a
time. So you fit the model, you discard the least important
feature, you fit the model, you discard the important
feature and so on until you have as many features left as
you want again. Again, this needs the model to meet some
measure of feature importance so you can use this with the
linear model or tree-based model. An example where you
cannot use this is, at least not in scikit-learn is Kernel
SVM or neural networks, because they don't really give you a
measure of feature importance easily. For each step feature
that we remove, we need to train a new model. So this is
much more expensive because we need to retrain the model
many times, but we're sort of being more careful in how we
remove the features.

This is implemented in RFE, for recursive feature
elimination, it works similar to SelectFromModel. To do RFE,
then the model that you want to use and then you can specify
how many features you want to select. Here I'm comparing the
ranking according to RFE. So when it dropped out the
features to the linear regression coefficients, which is
basically what I would use if I drop them off all at once,
and you can see that they're sort of similar. So there's
probably not a whole lot of difference, at least in this
case. You need to specify how many features you want to
select. But if you want to select only one feature, you have
to build many models and drop all the other features and so
on the way you tried out the model for keeping five features
and so on. So if you want a grid search this, doing this
independently would be a whole waste of time because they
would do the same thing over and over again.

# RFECV

print(boston.feature_names[rfe.support_])

pipe_rfe_ridgecv = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),
                                 RFECV(LinearRegression(), cv=10), RidgeCV())
np.mean(cross_val_score(pipe_rfe_ridgecv, X_train, y_train, cv=10))

So there's a thing called RFECV that allows you to do
efficient grid search for the number of features to keep.
This basically has built-in cross-validation, provides the
number of features to keep.

I’ve done RFECVC with linear regression and set it to do 10
fold cross-validation and then it will do the recursive
feature elimination inside cross-validation and so it goes
down from all features to just having one feature and with
cross-validation, it will select the best number.

pipe_rfe_ridgecv = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),
                                 RFECV(LinearRegression(), cv=10), RidgeCV())
np.mean(cross_val_score(pipe_rfe_ridgecv, X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.710

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
pipe_rfe_ridgecv = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), PolynomialFeatures(),
                                 RFECV(LinearRegression(), cv=10), RidgeCV())
np.mean(cross_val_score(pipe_rfe_ridgecv, X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.820
```

???
If we want to predict with the same model as used for
selection, RFECV can be used as the prediction step. Could
also use RFECV as transformer and use any other model!

# Wrapper Methods

- Can be applied for ANY model!
- Shrink / grow feature set by greedy search
- Called Forward or Backward selection
- Run CV / train-val split per feature
- Complexity: n_features * (n_features + 1) / 2
- Implemented in mlxtend

???

So as I set recourse to each elimination. So this is more
careful and it requires the model that gives you feature
importance. There's sort of more general reprimand sets that
are, in a sense, even more careful, but also more expensive,
but it can be applied to any model. These are sequential
feature selection. The idea is to either start with zero
features, and add the most important feature, or start with
all features and remove the least important feature at a
time. And you do this by not using a feature importance by
the model. But actually each step you basically do like one
step looking at search. So let's say I started with all the
features, I leave out the first feature, build the model and
but I don't only build a model, I do cross-validation of the
model on the subset so I get some accuracy or R squared
value. And I do this for every single feature. So I leave
each feature out and look at the cross-validate accuracy.
And I dropped the one that gives me the highest
cost-validated accuracy. 
	
So now basically, this is even more expensive than doing the
recursive feature elimination because I do a one step, look
ahead. So now the runtime is quadratic in the number of
features. Also for each iteration, I not only need to train
a single model, I need to do cross-validation. 

This is like a pretty standard method, because it's like
very general, and you can apply it to any model. It's like a
brute force search. Right now it's not in scikit-learn, but
it's in a package called mlxtend which has a couple other
tools. 

Mlxtend is luckily fully scikit-learn compatible, so you can
put it in a pipeline and everything's fine.

# SequentialFeatureSelector

.smaller[
```python
from mlxtend.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
sfs = SequentialFeatureSelector(LinearRegression(), forward=False, k_features=7)
sfs.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```
```
Features: 7/7
```
```python
print(sfs.k_feature_idx_)
print(boston.feature_names[np.array(sfs.k_feature_idx_)])
```
```
(1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12)
['ZN' 'NOX' 'RM' 'DIS' 'TAX' 'PTRATIO' 'LSTAT']
```
```python
sfs.k_score_
```
```
0.725
```

]

???
So from mlxtend, you get feature selection, sequential
feature selector, you put into the model, you tell it
whether you want to do forward or backward. Forward equal to
false means I started with all and I prune features one by
one. Forward equal to true means I start with zero features
and I use the one that gives me highest accuracy and then I
add one by one. As I said with sequential feature selector,
you need to specify the number of features and it does
internally cross-validation and it optimizes accuracy for
classification models and r square for regression models and
does this stepwise selection. One thing I should have
mentioned if you do feature selection this way,
theoretically, you can have a model for feature selection
that's different from the model for prediction. In here, if
you look at the top for the recursive feature elimination, I
use linear regression. But actually, the model I fit in the
end was a ridge model. So I could also use, let's say, a
tree-based model for feature selection and then the linear
model for prediction if I wanted to. It's not entirely clear
if that helps or makes sense, but it's sort of an additional
degree of freedom. And for example, if I want a very
interpretable model, I want my model that does the
predictions to be linear so I can explain to my boss what it
means. But I can also still do the feature selection using a
more complicated model and just tell my boss “Oh, only these
features are important and here's how I make the prediction”

# Questions ?
???
The question is if I do forward method or backward method
with the same number of features will the same happen? They
both are sort of one step look ahead approximations to
trying out all subsets and there's no guarantee we would get
the same thing.
