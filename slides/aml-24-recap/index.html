# Types of explanations

## Explain "kind of model"
- How would the model change if this feature was dropped?
- Doesn't explain this particular fitted model

##Explain model globally
- How does the output depend on the input?
- Often: some form of marginals


## Explain model locally
- Why did it classify this point this way?
- Explanation could look like a "global" one but be different for each point.
- "What is the minimum change to classify it differently?"

???
Marginals: how does the prediction change as function of a particular Features?

# Permutation importance
Idea: measure marginal influence of one feature

```python
def permutation_importance(est, X, y, n_bootstrap=100):
  baseline_score = estimator.score(X, y)
  for f_idx in range(X.shape[1]):
      for b_idx in range(n_bootstrap):
          X_new = X.copy()
          X_new[:, f_idx] = np.random.shuffle(X[:, f_idx])
          feature_score = estimator.score(X_new, y)
          scores[f_idx, b_idx] = baseline_score - feature_score
```
---
# Partial Dependence Plots

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/feat_impo_part_dep.png)
]

???
And so this is what the partner dependence plots look like.
So this is the most important feature, the second most
important feature and so on. This is sort of the marginal
contribution of each feature. Basically, in each tree,
you're summing out the contribution of all the other
features, and you look only at what is the contribution of
this particular feature. In general, this would be hard to
compute. For tree-based models you can compute is a very
efficient way because you can basically just sum up over the
whole space by traversing the tree.

Here with increased room size, the price increases and you
can see how it increases and you can see that there's like a
big step function here. And you can see that for increased
LSTAT, the price decreases. For the others, there aren’t any
drastic effect. There seems to be some threshold for NOX.
And something funky going on DIS.

The question is, so I said for random forest, you can't find
out the direction of which way the feature influences. But
that was for the feature importance. So the feature
importance tells the impurity decrease. So here I also look
at the feature importance and they're just numbers so they
don't give you the direction. For both gradient boosting and
random forest, you can look at partial dependency plot, and
they will give you a non-parametric model of how a single
feature influences it. Unfortunately, it’s not available in
scikit-learn. You could do the same thing for random
forests. Because in the end, the way they predict is quite
similar.

# Feature selection
## Why Select Features?

- Avoid overfitting (?)
- Faster prediction and training
- Less storage for model and dataset
- More interpretable model

???
There's a couple of reasons why you might want to feature
selection. One is to avoid overfitting and get a better
model. In practice, I have rarely seen that happen. It's not
usually what I would try to do to increase performance. If
I’m only interested in performance I probably would not try
to do automatic feature selection unless I think only a very
small subset of my feature is actually important. There's a
lot of increasing performance just by selecting only
important features.

What I think is more commonly, the reason to do automatic
feature selection is you want to shrink your model to make
faster predictions, to train your model faster, to store
fewer data and possibly to collect fewer data. If you're
collecting the data or to feature from some online process,
maybe it means you need fewer features, you need to store
less information. I think actually the top reason to do
feature selection is to have a more interpretable model. If
your model is smaller, if your model has 5 features instead
of 500, it's probably much easier for you to grasp what the
model does. If you can have a model that is as good with way
fewer features, it will be much easier to explain and most
people will be happy with it.

???
So second way to describe PCA is using Reconstruction Error.
I can look at how well this reconstruction here matches the
input space. And if I want a reconstruction X’, that is the
best possible in the least squares sense, so that is the
square norm. If I look at the square norm of X – X’, then
this is minimized exactly when I'm using X’, X’ is the PCA
reduction.

This is like written in a slightly different way. Because if
you solve this minimization problem, then you don't get the
rotation back, you get the data back. But this problem is
exactly solved by basically rotating using PCA direction,
dropping the data and then rotating back.

Maximizing the variance is the same thing as minimizing the
Reconstruction Error, given a fixed number of dimensions.



Find directions of maximum variance. (Find projection (onto
one vector) that maximizes the variance observed in the
data.)

Subtract projection onto u1, iterate to find more components.

# Manifold Learning

![:scale 100%](images/manifold-learning-structure.png)

???
Manifold learning is basically a class of algorithms that
are the much more complicated transformation of the data. A
manifold is a geometric structure in higher dimensions.

So the idea is that you have low dimensional space, and sort
of embedded into a high dimensional space. The classical
example is this Swiss roll.

Here, this is sort of a two-dimensional data set that was
embedded in a weird way in the three-dimensional data set.
And you hope to recover the structure of the data. And the
structure of the data here would be the 2D structure of the
layouts with Swiss roll. So PCA can't do that, because PCA
is only linear. So if you would project this down with two
dimensions, it's going to smooch all of these together and
the blue points will be very close to the red points, if it
projects down this axis, for example. And that's sort of not
really what the geometry of the data is like.

So for this, you would need nonlinear transformations of the
input space that can sort of try to capture the structure in
the data.



Learn underlying “manifold” structure, use for dimensionality reduction.

# Goals of Clustering

- Data Exploration
  - Are there coherent groups ?
  - How many groups are there ?

--

- Data Partitioning
  - Divide data by group before further processing

--

- Unsupervised feature extraction
  - Derive features from clusters or cluster distances

--

- Evaluation and parameter tuning
  - Quantitative measures of limited use
  - Usually qualitative measures used
  - Best: downstream tasks
  - What is your goal?
???
So why would we want to use a clustering algorithm? The
main usage that I've come across is exporation of the data
and understanding the structure of the data. Are there
similar groups within the data? What are these? How many are
there?  You can also use clustering to summarize or compress
the data by representing each group by a single prototype,
say the center. You can also use clustering if you want to
divide your data, for example if you want to know different
parts of the dataset behave fundamentally differently, so
you could for example cluster a dataset, and then apply,
say, a linear model, to each cluster. That would create a
more powerfull model than just learning a linear model on
the whole dataset.


Another use is unsupervised feature extraction. You can also
use clustering to derive a different representation of the
data.

An often cited application of clustering is customer
segmentation, though I'd say data exploration or feature
extraction are more common.

# K-Means algorithm

- Pick number of clusters k.
- Pick k random points as
“cluster center”
- While cluster centers change:
  1. Assign each data point to it’s closest cluster center
  2. Recompute cluster centers as the mean of the assigned points.
]
]

???
The algorithm proceeds like this: you pick the number of
clusters k, then you randomly pick k data points from the
data, and declare those as cluster centers. Then, you label
each data point according to which cluster center it is
closest to. Finally, you recompute the cluster centers as
the means of the clusters, and you iterate. The algorithm
always converges, which is when the assignment of the points
to the clusters doesn't change any more. Often you might
want to not wait until full convergence, but just stop if
the cluster centers don't move much between iterations.

So you can see the green cluster center moving towards the
red here until it has captured all the points in this group.
Questions? Who has seen this before?

There's a couple of nice things about this algorithm;

It's very easy to write down and understand. Each cluster is
represented by a center, which makes things simple, and you
can reassign any new point you observe to a cluster by just
computing the distances to all the cluster centers.

So in this case, if we build a model on some data that we
collected, we can easily apply this clustering to new data
points. That's not the case for all clustering algorithms.

In NMF, we compute X as a product of W and H. W stands for
weights, and H stands for hidden representation. We want to
find W and H so that their product is as close as possible
to X.

???
Here's an example of what this looks like in practice. Here
we have NMF and PCA.

This is the digit dataset, so the images are 28x28 grayscale
images. I have these the digits, 0 and 1, and I tried to
express them as a linear combination of the PCA components
and as a linear combination of the NMF components. Here, I
ordered them by which component is the most important for
each of these data points.

For both, 0 and 1, the most active component is this one,
which is a guess either 0 or 1, depending on whether it's
positive or negative. You can see that neither of these
latter components looks a hardly like a 0 or a 1.

What you’re seeing here is the cancellation effect taking
place.

The idea with NMF is that in NMF, hopefully, you got
something that’s more interpretable in particular, since
everything is positive.

Usually, we can't actually look at our data this easily and
so being able to interpret the component might be quite
important. Often, people use this for gene analysis, for
example, where you have very high dimensional vectors, and
if you want to see which genes act together and so having
these positive combinations really helps with
interpretability.

# Text Data: Bag of Words
.center[
<br>
![:scale 85%](images/bag_of_words.png)
]
???
The most common approach that people use for this is bag of
words, which is a very simple approach.

We start with a string which would be your whole document.
The first step is to tokenize it, which is basically
breaking it up the document into words. And then, you built
a vocabulary over all documents over all words.

So you look over all the movie reviews, or all the emails or
the text you have, and you collect all the tokens which are
representing the words.

Finally, using the vocabulary, you create a group
representation. The length of your feature vector will be
the size of the vocabulary. For each word in the vocabulary,
you count how often this word appears in the string that you
want to encode.

Most of the words in the English language don't appear in a
sentence. So most of these entries will be 0. But the word
‘ants’ appears once, so increment the count for ‘ants’ by 1
and so on.

So I'll have 6 non-zero entries and all the other entries
will be 0. So this is what we call like a very sparse vector
so most entries of this vector are 0.

When coding this, we’ll use a sparse matrix encoding. The
idea of sparse matrix encoding is that you only store the
non-zero entries.

So basically, we will only store the 1s, so storing the
string as a bag of word will cost us a nearly 6 floating
point numbers.

# N-grams: Beyond single words
- Bag of words completely removes word order.
- "didn't love" and "love" are very different!

--

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/single_words.png)
]
???
Because there's a big difference between ‘didn't love’ and
‘love’ and the default settings in the count vectorizer
cannot distinguish between the two because somewhere along
the document, it could appear ‘don't’ and you don't know if
it's in front of ‘love’, or if it’s ‘love, don't hate’ or
‘don't love hate’, since they basically have the same
representation.

The idea behind N-grams is you look at pairs of words that
appear next to each other. Unigrams looks at single words,
bigrams look at pairs of two words next to each other, and
trigrams looks at three words next to each other, and so on.


Here instead of splitting it up into single tokens, we can
split it up into pairs of tokens allowing me to have a
little bit of context around each of the words.


- N-grams: tuples of consecutive words

Here’s the architecture that we will be using for this. It's
kind of like neural network only, this is completely linear.
In the left-hand side, we have the input layer with one hot
encoding services in V-dimensional. V represents the size of
vocabulary. And basically, only one of them will be 1 and
the others will be 0.

Then we have a weight matrix connecting it to the
n-dimensional hidden layer. From there, we have multiple
outputs that correspond to the previous word, previous 2
words, and previous 3 words and so on. And then the next
word, next 2 words, next 3 words and so on.

Each output is, again, one hot encoding, which allows you to
predict each possible version of vocabulary. These layers
here are very large in size.

Behind the hidden layer is basically a logistic regression.
So this is just a linear classifier with a softmax
activation. So each of these Ws will try to predict what the
words are before and after.

Basically, you have one hot encoding, you've multiplied with
the first matrix, and then you multiply it with another
matrix and then you do softmax. The reason why you have
these two matrix multiplication is basically you want to
create a bottleneck so if you had a very wide vector, you
could do one matrix multiplication, basically, you want this
matrix to have a lower rank. So you want to compress a
representation to something small.

Each row of W corresponds to a single word. We train this
whole thing in a supervised fashion to minimize the log
loss. But we’re only interested in is getting weights w.

You can use these vectors to find relationships. So people
found that if they look at the difference between men, and
women, it looks very similar to the difference between uncle
and aunt or king and queen. They also found that, for
example, the difference between King and kings is the same
as between queen and Queens.

If you want to ask a question, what is to Queen as kings are
to King?

You can take vector representation of Queen and add the
vector representation of kings, and subtract the vector
representation of King. And if you look at the closest point
to that, you'll find it's going to be queens. People did
this with a lot of different sort of semantic pairs.

#Basic Architecture

]

`$ h(x) = f(W_1x+b_1) $`

`$ o(x) = g(W_2h(x) + b_2) $`
???
So now let's look at what a neural network is. It's very
similar to the logistic regression, only applied several
times.
So here I drew three inputs x, from which we compute
weighted sums. But now there is not only a single output,
but we compute several intermediate outputs,
the hidden units.
Each of the hidden units is a weighted sum of the inputs,
using different weights. Each hidden unit corresponds to an
inner product with a weight vector, so all together they
correspond to multiplying the input by a matrix, here a 3 by
4 matrix.
We also add a bias for each of the hidden units, so a vector
of dimension 4 for all of them. Then, we basically repeat
the process and compute again weighted sums of the hidden
units, to arrive at the outputs. Here this would correspond
to multiplying by a 4 by 2 matrix, and adding a vector of
dimension 2. Then we could apply for example a logistic
sigmoid or softmax to get a classification output.
So we basically do two matrix multiplications. If that was
all, we could simplify this by just multiplying the matrices
together into a single matrix, and we would just have a
linear model. But the interesting part is that in the hidden
layer, after we compute the weighted sum, we apply a
non-linear function, often called activation function or
just nonlinearity. That is what makes this whole function
non-linear, and allows us to express much more interesting
relationships. You can think of this as doing logistic
regression with learning non-linear basis functions. The
process is written here in formulas, we take the input x,
multiply with a matrix W, add a bias b, and apply a
non-linearity f, to get h. Then we multipy h by another
matrix W', add a bias b' and apply a non-linearity g. This
looks a bit like the word2vec we had last time, though here
it's really very important to have the non-linear activation
functions. Wha we want to learn from data are the weights
and biases, so in this case a 3x4 matrix, a vector of dim 4,
a 2x4 matrix and a vector of dim 2. Each of these steps of
computation is usually called a layer. Here we have an input
layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden
layer is called hidden because the computation is not
actually part of the result, it's just internal to the
algorithm. Though I'm drawing all these things in a similar
way, don't confuse them with graphical models, as I drew
them for latent dirichlet allocation.
All these nodes here are completely deterministic functions,
and the graph just illustrates very simple computations.

???
Here is the architecture of an early convolutional net
form 1998. The basic architecture in current
networks is still the same.
You can multiple layers of convolutions and resampling
operations. You start convolving the image, which
extracts local features. Each convolutions creates
new “feature maps” that serve as input to later
convolutions.
To allow more global operations, after the convolutions
the image resolution is changed. Back then it was
subsampling, today it is max-pooling.
So you end up with more and more feature maps with
lower and lower resolution.
At the end, you have some fully connected layers to do
the classificattion.

# Tricks for learning Deep Nets

# Drop-out Regularization

.center[
![:scale 75%](images/dropout_reg.png)
]
???
For each sample, during training, you actually remove
certain hidden nodes. So basically, you just X out the
activations.

You do this every time you trade over a training sample
anew. So, this will be different for every example. The idea
at the very high level is to add noise into the training
procedure so that you basically make it harder to overfit.
Since you drop out these parts, it gets much harder for the
model to learn the training set by heart because you always
remove different information.

The goal is that you then learn weights that are more robust
and since you're trying to prevent overfitting that possibly
generalizes better.

The dropout rate is often pretty high, sometimes it 50%,
which means you set 50% of your units to zero.

This is only during learning. You only want to add noise in
the learning process. When you want to do predictions, you
use all the weights but down weight them by the drop out
rate.

Here, we're not only perturbing the input image, but we're
also perturbing the hidden units in a very particular way.
As it turns out that actually works much better than just
adding noise to the input.

Another relatively recent advance in neural networks is
batch normalization. The idea is that neural networks
learn best when the input is zero mean and unit
variance. We can scale the data to get that.
But each layer inside a neural network is itself a neural
network with inputs given by the previous layer. And
that output might have much larger or smaller scale
(depending on the activation function).
Batch normalization re-normalizes the activations for a
layer for each batch during training (as the
distribution over activation changes). The avoids
saturation when using saturating functions.
To keep the expressive power of the model, additional
scale and shift parameters are learned that are
applied after the per-batch normalization.

# Residual Neural Networks
# # Problem
![:scale 90%](images/resnet-no-deep-nets.png)
???
We can't fit deep networks well - not even on training set!
"vanishing gradient problem" - was motivation for relu, but not solved yet.


The deeper the network gets, usually the performance gets
better. But if you make your network too deep, then you
can't learn it anymore.

This is on CIFAR-10, which is a relatively small dataset.
But if you try to learn a 56-layer convolutional, you cannot
even optimize it on the training set. So basically, it's not
that we can't generalize, we can't optimize. So these are
universal approximators, so ideally, we should be able to
overfit completely the training set.

But here, if we make it too deep, we cannot overfit the
training set anymore. It's kind of a bad thing. Because we
can’t really optimize the problem. So this is sort of
connected to this problem of vanishing gradient that it's
very hard to backpropagate the error through a very deep net
because basically, the idea is that the further you get from
the output, the gradients become less and less informative.
We talked about RELU units, which sort of helped to make
this a little bit better. Without RELU units, you had like 4
or 5 layers, with RELU units, you have like 20 layers. But
if you do 56 layers, it's not going to work anymore.

Even it's not going to work anymore, even on the training
set. So this has been like a big problem. And it has a
surprisingly simple solution, which is the RES-NET layer.

# Solution
![:scale 60%](images/residual-layer.png)

`$$y = F(x, \{W_i\}) + x  \quad \text{ for same size layers}$$`

--

`$$y = F(x, \{W_i\}) + W_sx \quad \text{ for different size layers}$$`

???
instead of learning a function. learn the difference to identity.
if sizes different, add linear projection.

Here's how the residual layer looks like. And the idea is,
let's say you have a bunch of weight layers, instead of
learning a function, we learn how the function is different
from the identity.

So you're not trying to model the whole relationship between
x and y, you want to model how is y different from x.

In practice, what happens is you have multiple weight
layers, usually like 2, and you have skip connection that
gives the identity from before these layers to after these
layers.

So basically, if you set these weights all to zero, you have
a pass-through layer. And this allows information to be
back-propagated much more easily because you have all these
identity matrices, so something always gets backpropagated.
So this obviously only works if y and x have the same shape.


So in CNNs, often the convolutional layers have sort of the
same shape. But then you also have max-pooling layers. And
so what you can do is, instead of having the identity, you
use a linear transformation.

And this way, the gradients can propagate better. So just
seems like a very simple idea but people have tried it
before and it really made a big difference.

dotted lines are linear projection, others are identity.


MTG19, which a state of the art neural network before and
these are all the layers.

Next to it is a 34 layered, convolutional neural network.

And then is the residual network. For each pair of two
layers, you add in a skip connection. This black arrow is
just an identity mapping because things are the same size.
If there's pooling, there's this dashed arrow, which is a
linear transformation. But basically, they're sort of a
pathway that allows you to project the identity from the
very beginning to the very end. Or from the output signal
you get back towards the beginning.
