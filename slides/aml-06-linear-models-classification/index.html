# Linear Models for Classification

Today we're going to talk about linear models for
classification, and in addition to that some general
principles and advanced topics surrounding general models,
both for classification and regression.

FIXME: in regularizing SVM, long vs short normal vectors.

# Linear models for <strong>binary</strong> classfication

???
We'll first start with linear models for binary
classification, so if there are only two classes. That makes
the models much easier to understand.

---
.center[
![:scale 55%](images/linear_boundary_vector.png)
]

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b) = \text{sign}\left(\sum\limits_{i}w_ix_i + b\right)$$

???
Similar to the regression case, basically all linear models
for classification have the same way to make predictions. As
with regression, they compute an inner product of a weight
vector w with the feature vector x, and add some bias b. The
result of that is a real number, as in regression. For
classification, however, we only look at the sign of the
result, so whether it is negative or positive. If it's
positive, we predict one class, usually called +1, if it's
negative, we predict the other class, usually called -1. If
the result is 0, by convention the positive class is
predicted, but because it's a floating point number that
doesn't really happen in practice. You'll see that sometimes
in my notation I will not have a $b$. That's because you can
always add a constant feature to x to achieve the same
effect (thought you would then need to leave that feature
out of the regularization). So when I write $w^Tx$ without a
$b$ assume that there is a constant feature added that is
not part of any regularization.

Geometrially, what the formula means is that the decision
boundary of a linear classifier will be a hyperplane in the
feature space, where w is the normal vector of that plane.
In the 2d example here, it's just a line separating red and
blue. Everything on the right hand side would be classified
as blue by this classifier, and everything on the left-hand
side as red.

Questions? So again, the learning here consists of finding
parameters w and b based on the training set, and that is
where the different algorithms differ. There are quite a lot
of algorithms out there, and there are also quite a lot in
scikit-learn, but we'll only discuss the most common ones.

The most straight-forward way to approach finding w and b is
to use the framework of empirical risk minimization that we
talked about last time, so finding parameters that minimize
some loss o the training set. Where classification differs
quite a bit from regression is on how we want to measure
misclassifications.


---

# Picking a loss?

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{y_i \neq \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)}$$`

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/binary_loss.png)
]

???
So we need to define a loss function for given w and b that
tell us how well they fit the training set. Obvious Idea:
Minimize number of misclassifications aka 0-1 loss but this
loss is non-convex, not continuous and minimizing it is
NP-hard. So we need to relax it, which basically means we
want to find a convex upper bound for this loss. This is not
done on the actual prediction, but on the inner product $w^T
x$, which is also called the decision function. So this
graph here has the inner product on the x axis, and shows
what the loss would be for class 1. The 0-1 loss is zero if
the decision function is positive, and one if it's negative.
Because a positive decision function means a positive
predition, means correct classification in the case of y=1.
A negative prediction means a wrong classification, which is
penalized by the 0-1 loss with a loss of 1, i.e. one
mistake.

The other losses we'll talk about are mostly the hinge loss
and the log loss. You can see they are both upper bounds on
the 0-1 loss but they are convex and continuous. Both of
these losses care not only that you make a correct
prediction, but also "how correct" your prediction is, i.e.
how positive or negative your decision function is. We'll
talk a bit more about the motivation of these two losses,
starting with the logistic loss.

# Logistic Regression


.left-column[
$$\log\left(\frac{p(y=1|x)}{p(y=0|x)}\right) = w^T\textbf{x}$$

$$p(y|\textbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-w^T\textbf{x}}}$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} -\sum_{i=1}^n \log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1)$$`


$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T\textbf{x} + b)$$
]
.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/img_3.png)]


???
Logistic regression is probably the most commonly used
linear classifier, maybe the most commonly used classifier
overall. The idea is to model the log-odds, which is log
p(y=1|x) - log p(y=0|x) as a linear function, as shown here.
Rearranging the formula, you get a model of p(y=1|x) as 1
over 1 + ... This function is called the logistic sigmoid,
and is drawn to the right here. Basically it squashed the
linear function $w^Tx$ between 0 and 1, so that it can model
a probability.

Given this equation for p(y|x), what we want to do is
maximize the probability of the training set under this
model. This approach is known as maximum likelihood.
Basically you want to find w and b such that they assign
maximum probability to the labels observed in the training
data. You can rearrange that a bit and end up with this
equation here, which contains the log-loss as seen on the
last slide.

The prediction is the class with the higher probability. In
the binary case, that's the same as asking whether the
probability of class 1 is bigger or smaller than .5. And as
you can see from the plot of the logistic sigmoid, the
probability of the class +1 is greater than .5 exactly if
the decision function $w^T x$ is greater than 0. So
predicting the class with maximum probability is the same as
predicting which side of the hyperplane given by w we are
on.

Ok so this is logistic regression. We minimize this loss and
get a w which defines a hyper plane. But if you think back
to last time, this is only part of what we want. This
formulation tries to fit the training data, but it doesn't
care about finding a simple solution.

# Penalized Logistic Regression

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1) + ||w||_2^2$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1) + ||w||_1$$`

- C is inverse to alpha (or alpha / n_samples)

- Both versions strongly convex, l2 version smooth (differentiable).

- All points contribute to $w$ (dense solution to dual).

???

So we can do the same we did for regression: we can add
regularization terms using the L1 and L2 norm. The effects
are the same as for regression: both push the coefficients
towards zero, but the l1 norm encourages coefficients to be
exactly zero, for the same reasons we discussed last time.

You could also use a mixed penalty to get something like the
elasticnet. That's not implemented in the logisticregression
class in scikit-learn right now, but it's certainly a
sensible thing to do.

Here I used a slightly different notation as last time,
though. I'm not using alpha to multiply the regularizer,
instead I'm using C to multiply the loss. That's mostly
because that's how it's done in scikit-learn and it has only
historic reasons. The idea is exactly the same, only now C
is 1 over alpha. So large C means heavy weight to the loss,
means little regularization, while small C means less weight
on the loss, means strong regularization.

Depending on the model, there might be a factor of n_samples
in there somewhere. Usually we try to make the objective as
independent of the number of samples as possible in
scikit-learn, but that might lead to surprises if you're not
aware of it.

Some side-notes on the optimization problem: here, as in
regression, having more regularization makes the
optimization problem easier. You might have seen this in
your homework already, if you decrease C, meaning you add
more regularization, your model fits more quickly.

One particular property of the logistic loss, compared to
the hinge loss we'll discuss next is that each data point
contributes to the loss, so each data point has an effect on
the solution. That's also true for all the regression models
we saw last time.

# (soft margin) linear SVM

.larger[
`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\max(0,1-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + ||w||_2^2$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\max(0,1-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i)+ ||w||_1$$`
]

- Both versions strongly convex, neither smooth.

- Only some points contribute (the support vectors) to $w$ (sparse solution to dual).

???
Moving from logistic regression to linear SVMs is just a
matter of changing the loss from the log loss to the hinge
loss. The hinge-loss is defined as ... And we can penalize
using either l1 or l2 norm, or again, in principle also
elastic net. This formulation with the hinge loss doesn't
really make sense without the penalty, because of the
formulation of the hinge loss. What this loss says is
basically "if you predict the right class with a margin of
1, there is no loss". Otherwise the loss is linear in the
decision function. So you need to be on the right side of
the hyperplane by a given amount, and then there is no more
loss. That's the reason you need the penalty, for the 1 to
make sense. Otherwise you could just scale up $w$ to make it
far enough on the right side. But the regularization
penalizes growing $w$.

The hinge loss has a kink, same as the l1 norm, and so it's
not a smooth optimization problem any more, but that's not
really a big deal. What's interesting is that all the points
that are classified correctly with a margin of at least 1
have a loss of zero, and so they don't influence the
solution any more. All the point that are not classified
correctly by this margin are the ones that do influence the
solution and they are called the support vectors.

# Logistic Regression vs SVM

???

So this is the main difference between logistic regression
and linear SVMs: Does it penalize misclassifications
according to the green line, or according to the blue line?
In practice it doesn't make a big difference.

---


# SVM or LogReg?

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/svm_or_lr.png)
]

- Need compact model or believe solution is sparse? Use L1

???
So which one of them should you use? If you need probability
estimates, you should use logistic regression. If you don't,
you can pick either, and it doesn't really matter. Logistic
regression can be a bit faster to optimize in theory. If
you're in a setting where there's many more feature than
samples, it might make sense to use linear SVMs and solve
the dual, but you can actually solve either of the problems
in the dual, and we'll talk about what that means in
practice in a little bit.

---

# Effect of regularization


.center[
![:scale 90%](images/linear_svm_regularization.png)
]

- Small C (a lot of regularization) limits the influence of individual points!

???

So I spared you with coefficient plots, because they looks
the same as for regression. All the things I said about
model complexity and dependency on the number of features
and samples is as true for classification as it is for
regression.

There is another interesting way to thing about
regularization that I found helpful, though. I'm not going
to walk through the math for this, but you can reformulate
the optimization problem and find that what the C parameter
does is actually limit the influence of individual data
points. With very large C, we said we have no
regularization. It also means individual data points can
have basically unlimited influence, as you can see here.
There are two outliers here, which basically completely tilt
the decision boundary. But if we decrease C, and therefore
increase the regularization, what happens is that the
influence of these outlier points becomes limited, and the
other points get more influence.

# Multiclass classification


???

Ok, so I think that's enough on the two loss functions and
regularization, and hopefully you have a bit of a feel for
how these two classifiers work, and also an understanding
that they are in fact quite similar in practice.

Next I want to look at how to go from binary classification
to multi-class classification. Basically there is a simple
but hacky way, and there's a slightly more complicated but
theoretically sound way.

# Reduction to Binary Classification
.padding-top[
.left-column[
## One vs Rest
]

.right-column[
## One vs One
]
]
???
The slightly hacky way is using what's known as a reduction.
We're doing a reduction like in math: reducing one problem
to another. In this case we're reducing the problem of
multi-class classification into several instances of the
binary classification problem. And we already know how to
deal with binary classification.

There are two straight-forward ways to reduce multi-class to
binary classification. the first is called one vs rest, the
second one is called one-vs-one.

---

# One Vs Rest

For 4 classes:

1v{2,3,4}, 2v{1,3,4}, 3v{1,2,4}, 4v{1,2,3}

In general:

n binary classifiers - each on all data

???
Let's start with One vs Rest. here, we learn one binary
classifier for each class against the remaining classes. So
let's say we have 4 classes, called 1 to 4.  First we learn
a binary classifier of the points in class 1 vs the points
in the classes 2, 3 and 4.  Then, we do the same for class
2, and so on. The way we end up building as many classifiers
as we have classes.

# Prediction with One Vs Rest


"Class with highest score"

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg}\max_{i \in Y} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x}$$

Unclear why it works, but work well.


???
To make a prediction, we compute the decision function of
all classifiers, say 4 in the example, on a new data point.
The one with the highest score for the positive class, the
single class, wins, and that class is predicted.

It's a little bit unclear why this works as well as it does.
Maybe there's some papers about that now, but I'm not 

So in this case we have one coefficient vector w and one
bias b for each class.

---

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_lines.png)
]


???
Here is an illustration of what that looks like.
Unfortunately it's a bit hard to draw 4 classes in general
position in 2 dimensions, so I only used 3 classes here. So
each class has an associated coefficient vector and bias,
corresponding to a line. The line tries to separate this
class from the other two classes.
# Fixme draw ws?

---

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_boundaries.png)
]


???

Here are the decision boundaries resulting from the these
three binary classifiers. Basically what they say is that
the line that is closest decides the class. What you can not
see here is that each of the lines also have a magnitude
associated with them. It's not only the direction of the
normal vector that matters, but also the length. You can
think of that as some form of uncertainty attached to the
line.

# One Vs One

- 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, 2v3, 2v4, 3v4
- n * (n-1) / 2 binary classifiers - each on a fraction of the data


- "Vote for highest positives"
- Classify by all classifiers.
- Count how often each class was predicted.
- Return most commonly predicted class.
- Again - just a heuristic.


???

The other method of reduction is called one vs one. In one
vs one, we build one binary model for each pair of classes.
In the example of having four classes that is one for 1 vs
2, one for 1v3 and so on. So we end up with n * (n - 1) /2
binary classifiers. And each is trained only on the subset
of the data that belongs to these classes.

To make a prediction, we again apply all of the classifiers.
For each class we count how often one of the classifiers
predicted that class, and we predict the class with the most
votes.

Again, this is just a heuristic and there's not really a
good theoretical explanation why this should work.

# One vs One Prediction

![:scale 80%](images/ovo_lines.png)


???
Here is an example for predicting on three classes in 2d
using the one-vs-one heuristic. In the case of three
classes, there's also three pairs. Three is a bit of a
special case, with any more classes there would be more
classifiers than classes.

The dashed lines are colored according to the pair of
classes they separate. So the green and blue line separates
the green and blue classes. The data points belonging to the
grey class were not used in building this model at all.
---

class: center
# One vs One Prediction


![:scale 80%](images/ovo_boundaries.png)


???

Looking at the predictions made by the one vs one classifier
the correspondence to the binary decision boundaries is a
bit more clear than for the one vs rest heuristic, because
it only takes the actual boundaries into account, not the
length of the normal vectors. That makes it easier to
visualize the geometry, but it's also a bit of a downside of
the method because it means it discards any notion of
uncertainty that was present in the binary classifiers. The
decision boundary for each class is given by the two lines
that this class is involved in. So the grey class is bounded
by the green and grey line and the blue and grey line.

There is a triangle in the center in which there is one vote
for each of the classes.  In this implemenatation the tie is
broken to just always predict the first class, which is the
green one. That might not be the best tie breaking strategy,
but this is a relatively rare case, in particular if there's
more than three classes.

OVR and OVO are general heuristics not restricted to linear
models. They can be used whenever a binary model for
classification needs to be extended to the multi-class case.
For logistic regression, there is actually a natural
extension of the formulation, and we don't have to resort to
these hacks.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression

Probabilistic multi-class model:

$$p(y=i|x) = \frac{e^{\textbf{w}_i^T\textbf{x}}}{\sum_j e^{\textbf{w}_j^T\textbf{x}}}$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} \sum_{i=1}^n \log(p(y=y_i|x_i))$$`

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg} \max_{i \in Y} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x}$$

- Same prediction rule as OvR !

???
The binary logistic regression case can be generalized to
multinomial logistic regression, in which we model the
probability that i is one of the classes using this formula,
which is also known as softmax. The probability is
proportional to e to the minus $w^t x$ which is the same as
in the binary case. But now we need to normalize it so that
the sum over all classes is one. So we just divide it by
this sum.

# In sckit-learn

- OvO: only SVC
- OvR: default for all linear models, even LogisticRegression
- `LogisticRegression(multinomial=True)`
- `clf.decision_function` = $w^Tx$
- `logreg.predict_proba`
- `SVC(probability=True)` not great


???
All the models in scikit-learn have multi-class built-in and
most of them use One versus Rest. There's only one model
that uses One versus One which is SVC. The Kernel SVM uses
One versus One because of the authors of the SVM like that.
For historical reasons, logistic regression also uses One
versus Rest by default in scikit-learn. That's probably not
a good idea, but we can’t really change the default easily.
Usually, if you do multiclass you probably want to use
multinomial logistic regression and so you set multinomial
to true and then it does multinomial logistic regression.
Question: Does that make it run faster? Answer: Its unlikely
to make it run faster, but it makes it more theoretically
sound and gives you better probabilities. The probabilities
that come out of it, if you do OvR, are a complete hack in
the multi-class case but in the binary case, it’s the same.
Logistic regression also has a predict_prob method. This
method gives the probability estimates, so you get a vector
of length number of classes for each data point. You might
be tempted to do SVC (probability) equal to true. That is
something we're going to talk about in a couple of weeks.
This is is running calibration. Basically, this does the One
versus One SVM and then it builds a second model on top that
tries to estimate probabilities using built-in
cross-validation. This will take forever and the outcome
will probably be not that great. Don't do this unless you're
really sure this is what you want to do. If you want
probabilities just use logistic regression. predict_proba
gives you the probabilities. If you call predict_proba, it
will give you an array that has number of samples times
number of classes and these entries will sum to one. And the
prediction is just the arg max of these. You can call
predict which will give you arg max while predict_proba will
give you the probabilities as given by the model.

# Multi-Class in Practice


OvR and multinomial LogReg produce one coef per class:

.center[

SVC would produce the same shape, but with different semantics!


???
In practice, I'm using logistic regression on the iris
dataset. We have 50 data points, 4 features, 3 classes, each
class has 50 samples, and we’re trying to classify different
kinds of irises. Here, I'm looking at logistic regression
and linear SVM, I built the model. So the coefficient W is
stored in coef on this score. Everything in scikit-learn
that's estimated from the data ends with an underscore. If
it doesn't, it wasn't learned from the data. So coef_ are
the coefficient that is learned by the model. They’re for
logistic regression and linear Support Vector Machine,
they're the same shape, three classes times four features
but they have different semantics

Here I’ve interpreted them. You can see the four features,
for each feature and for each class, you have a coefficient.
If the sepal width is big, then the setosa classifier is
happy. If the sepal with is small then versicolor will have
a large response. If the petal width is big then virginica
will have a large response. This is a bar plot after
coefficient vector here. This tells you what the classifier
has learned. This is maybe for a very simple problem this is
little much to look at but it's still way less to look at
for any other model. If you used a random forest or
something like that, there would be no way to visualize
what's happening.

# Computational Considerations
#(for all linear models)

Now I want to talk about more general things, how to make
your homework run faster, also called Computational
Considerations.

class: some-space

# Solver choices

- Don’t use `SVC(kernel='linear')`, use `LinearSVC`
- For `n_features >> n_samples`: Lars (or LassoLars) instead of Lasso.
- For small n_samples (<10.000?), don’t worry.
- `LinearSVC`, `LogisticRegression`: `dual=False` if `n_samples >> n_features`
- `LogisticRegression(solver="sag")` for `n_samples` large.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent for `n_samples` really
large


???
Some of the things here are specific to scikit-learn and
some are not. Scikit-learn has SVC and the linear SVC, and
they're both support vector machines. SVC uses One versus
One while linear SVC uses one versus rest. SVC uses the
hinged loss while linear SVC uses squared hinge loss. Linear
SVC will provide faster results than SVC. If you want to do
regression with a large number of features, you should
probably use Lars or LassoLars, which allows you to do
feature selection much more quickly than Lasso. Generally,
if you have a few samples, don't worry, any model will find
and everything will be sparse. If you have, let's say 10,000
samples all linear models will be fast all the time.
Otherwise, use this for regression. For classification, if
the number of samples is much greater than the number of
features use dual=false. Basically, solving a dual problem
means solving something where there are as many variables as
the number of samples, that's the default. Whereas solving
the primal problem, so dual=false means solving something
that's with the number of variables as the same number of
features. If the number of features is big, dual should be
true, and if the number of samples is big dual should be
false. If you have really a whole lot of samples you can use
a recent solver called sag. This works really for really
large samples. So LogisticRegression(solver=”sag”) that can
use L1 or L2 penalties or whatever you want. Then finally,
if you have an extremely large amount of data you can use
Stochastic Gradient Descent. It has the STD classifier, STD
regressor, and hopefully, we'll have enough time to talk
about these today. But generally often setting dual to false
will help you a lot and setting the solver to something else
might help you. All of these basically give you the same
solution but only at different speeds. I want to talk about
some tips for getting cross-validation. There are some
built-in tools for doing quicker cross-validation for linear
models.

# Efficient Cross-Validation

cross-validation.

# Models with build-in cross-validation

- LarsCV(), LassoLarsCV(), ElasticNetCV()<br/>Use path-algorithms to compute the full solution path.
- LogisticRegressionCV() uses warm-starts, doesn’t support all solvers.
- All have reasonable build-in parameter grids.
- RidgeCV() - does GCV, approximation to LOO<br />
So you can’t pick the “cv”!


???
There’s a couple of models that have that. Lars, LassoLars,
Elastic Net, Logistic Regression and Ridge have a thing
called named “the model name”+ “CV”. It means it has
built-in cross-validation to adjust the parameters. They do
different things behind the scenes and they always make
things much faster. For the Lars, Lasso Lars, Elastic Net
they compute this coefficient passes that we looked at. They
compute the solution for all possible values of the
parameter by computing the whole path and that means it's
much faster to fit this than trying for each parameter
setting to fit it individually. For Logistic Regression that
uses warm-starts which means it starts with one parameter
setting like C equal to very small with a lot of
regularization that’s fast to compute. Then once it has a
solution it'll use the solution as a starting point for the
solution for the next biggest C. But that only works with
some of us solvers. All of them have sort of reasonable
built-in parameter grids so you don't need to actually worry
too much about how to set the parameters. RidgeCV actually
works differently. For the discussed four, you can tell it
what cross-validation to use and it will use that
cross-validation but it will use something like a path
algorithm to compute the solution for many of the
regularization parameters at once. On the contrary, RidgeCV
independently solves each regularization parameter, but it
has a trick to make the cross-validation go faster. You can
actually approximate Leave One Out Cross-Validation in Ridge
in closed form. Leave One Out cross-validation is basically
Leave One Out at one point at a time and built a model. So
to compute these exactly, usually, I need to build the
number of samples, many models. Also, it has a very high
variance. For Ridge, I can actually compute exactly in
closed form, given the model. So you can’t pick the CV, it
will always do something that's equivalent to Leave One Out
but you can pick any grid because it'll just evaluate the
grid using a for loop.

# Using EstimatorCV

Here's a very small example of how this would look like.
Here I use GridSearchCV with Ridge with like. It does 10
fold cross-validation. This builds 10 models times 10
parameter settings. RidgeCV by default has the same
parameter settings but instead of doing 10 times 10 models,
we only do 10 models because we get the Leave One Out
cross-validation for free and they come up with the same
result. They both have the same tested score and they have
the same alpha that is selected. Only the second one is 10
times faster. This is pretty helpful. It's a little bit
tricky if you have multiple pre-processing steps, and we'll
talk about this later in the course. The problem here is
that if you have pre-processing, you want to pre-process to
be inside the cross-validation and if you use something like
RidgeCV or LassoCV, you can really put any preprocessing
inside this cross-validation and that's not so great.

???
The last thing I want to talk about today is Stochastic
Gradient Descent. This is just another solver to solve
linear models or neural networks. But it's good to
understand a little bit more in detail because it comes up a
lot in particular with very large data sets.

# Decomposing Generalization Error

.center[

Bottou et. al.

???
The idea here is that if you have a lot of data, maybe
solving the problem exactly isn't as important as looking at
all of the data. Let's say I want to find a good function
that generalizes well over to test dataset and I have a
budget of how many data points I can look at it and I want
to approximate the best possible function on the training
set with an accuracy of epsilon. What we want is a model of
generalized as well, what we do in practice is we pick a
family of functions, like the linear functions, we estimate
the best function using the training set, we want one that's
the best on the true distribution, but instead we're using
the training set and then we need to have some numeric
optimization procedure that optimizes it until the error is
smaller than epsilon for whatever loss, the loss could be
regularized or anything but still we need to minimize
optimization problem to some precision and we can only use
at most as much data points as their dataset. And we've only
a particular budget of time that it can use. So these are
sort of the restrictions we have. And we want to find the
best model.

class: center, middle

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_14.png)

???
So now let's look at what happens to these three errors in
the time if we increase different parts. If we make the
family of functions bigger, so let's say we use from linear
function to neural networks or we go to a high dimensional
space, the approximation error, that’s the error that we get
by restricting ourselves to do class goes down because we
have a richer class. The estimation error which means the
error we get by using the training set, instead of having
access to the true distribution gets larger because we have
more flexibility in our model, so the distance between what
the ideal will be on the true distribution and the training
data set becomes bigger. And if we have a larger family of
functions obviously it's going to take longer. If you have
more data points, the estimation error will go down. So our
optimization will be closer to what is the true
distribution, but it will take more time. The final row
represents the precision to which I want to optimize, the
epsilon in which I want to stop optimizing the problem that
I'm optimizing. The optimization error will go up, but the
time will go down. It's faster if I optimize less strongly.

# The Trade-off

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_math_1.png)
]
- If `$n_\text{max}$` is large, we are constraint by $T_\max$!
- Use a worse algorithm but look at more data!


???
If the number of data points is really large, the thing that
we really constraint is by the runtime.  If constrained by
the runtime, can't we just subsample the data? Yes, you
could. Then you would run faster. But the point that he's
making is it's better to look at all of the data and so
we're decreasing estimation error but we don't find a
precise solution. So now we say it's more important to
minimize the estimation error, which we can do by looking at
a lot of data than actually optimizing it very precisely
because the thing that we are optimizing is a training set
error, which is not really the thing that we're interested
in the first place. So we look at the algorithm that does
worst in terms of optimization, but it's much faster. This
is the algorithm that’s most commonly used and the algorithm
is Stochastic Gradient Descent.

# Reminder: Gradient Descent

.right-column[![:scale 1-0%](images/img_15.png)]

Want: $$\arg \min_w F(w)$$

Initialize $w_0$

$$w^{(i+1)} \leftarrow w^{(i)} - \eta_i\frac{d}{dw}F(w^{(i)})$$

Converges to local minimum

???
First, let's talk about Gradient Descent. So we have some
function we want to minimize here the function is Lasso
training data set plus the regularizer. F is the objective
of the model and I want to find the best parameter setting
w. The way gradient descent works are that we initialize it
with some W and then we compute a gradient then we walk down
the gradient by a small step. This converges to a local
minimum in the function. For linear models, there's only one
global minimum. Basically, any optimization algorithm you
can think of will always converge to the same solution, they
only converge at different speeds.

$$w^{(i+1)} \leftarrow w^{(i)} - \eta_i\frac{d}{dw}F(w^{(i)})$$

???
A little bit of an issue here is picking a learning rate
which is how big a step are you making. If you make too
small a step, then you're going to get stuck wherever you're
started. If you pick the right step size, you can make very
quick progress. If you pick too a big step size, you're
going to be missing the target and just jumping around the
target. This is a very simple optimizer. But it's not great
and it’s not very fast because you need to compute gradients
over the whole dataset. What you can do instead is you can
approximate a gradient by looking only a single data point
at a time.

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Logistic Regression:

`$$F(w) = -C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + ||w||_2^2$$`


- Pick $x_i$ randomly, then

`$$\frac{d}{dw}F(w) = \frac{d}{dw} -C \log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + \frac{1}{n}||w||_2^2$$`

- In practice: just iterate over i.


???
Looking at the Logistic Regression, the functional Logistic
Regression we want to minimize is the log loss plus the
regularizer. Instead of looking at the gradient for the
whole sum here, we can get a stochastic approximation of the
gradient by looking at only one of the sums at a time. In
practice, we iterate over the dataset and go one by one
through all the data points. We make sure we shuffle them
before. Then we do small gradient steps. This is a very bad
optimizer compared to the SAG but it can go very quickly
over a lot of data.

# SGD and partial_fit

- SGDClassifier(), SGDRegressor() fast on very large datasets
- Tuning learning rate and schedule can be tricky.
- partial_fit allows working with out-of-memory data!


???
This is implemented in SGD classifier, and SGD regressor and
you can use it in very large data sets. It's a little bit
tricky to tune the learning rate and so you can either pick
as constant learning rate, or you can pick an exponentially
decreasing learning rate. There's one that's called optimal.
If you scale your data to standard division 1, then the
optimal one will often work well but it's not actually
optimal on any sense. This will allow you to give you
something quickly on a big data set. There's also another
thing you can do, there's a method called partial_fit that
these models have which allows you to iteratively fit feed
it data. If you have like streaming data coming in and you
having infinite data, you can just keep giving it more and
more data called partial_fit. This method will update the
model. In scikit-learn, if you call fit multiple times it
will always forget whatever it saw before. Each fit resets
the model while partial fit will remember what it saw before
and keeps fitting the model. SGDClassifier() and
SGDRegressor both have a whole bunch of different loss
function penalties so they both can do elastic net penalty
and the classifier can do logistic loss and hinge loss and
squared hinge loss and the regressor can do Huber loss and
squared error and absolute error. So there are many, many
different choices for different loss functions.

![:scale 90%](images/img_19.png)



???
Fit works just like everywhere else. Partial fit you can
call it with different batches of data and this will keep
fitting the model. One thing that you should keep in mind
for the classifier is that you need to give it the classes
at the beginning because it doesn't know how many classes
there are and at the first time, not all the classes might
be present in the data you give it to. So you need to
specify how many classes there are. Partial fit doesn't do
loops over a dataset. So if you want to use a partial fit,
and you want to loop over dataset multiple times, you have
to set the loop yourself. If you loop over a dataset, if you
do more of gradient descent, then you get better results.
This code is the same code for all combinations of losses
and regularizers because it’s very simple to write this
down.
