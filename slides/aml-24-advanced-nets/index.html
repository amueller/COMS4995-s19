- Train on “large enough” data.

- Apply to new “small” dataset.

- Take activations of last or second to last fully
connected layer.


Often we have a small but specific image dataset for a
particular application. Training a neural net is not
feasible unless we have tens of thousands or
hundreds of thousands of images.
However, if we have a convolutional neural net that
was already trained on a large dataset that is similar
enough, we can hope that the features it learned are
also helpful for our task.
The easiest way to adapt a trained network to a new
task is to just apply it to our dataset and take the
activations of the second to last or last layer.
If the original task was rich enough – say 10000
different classes as in imagenet – these layers
contain a lot of information about the image.
We can then use these activations as features for
another classifier like a linear model or smaller dense
neural network.

The main point is that we don’t need to retrain all the
weights in the network. You can think of it as
retraining only the last layer – the classification layer
– of the network, while holding all the convolutional
filters fixed. If they learned generic patterns like
edges and patterns, these will still be useful for your
task.
You can download pre-trained neural networks for
many architectures online.
Using a pre-trained network is sometimes also known
as transfer learning.
This potentially doesn’t work with images from a very
different domain, like medical images.

- Start with pre-trained net

- Back-propagate error through all layers

- “tune” filters to new data.

A more complicated variant of this is to load a network
trained on some other dataset, and replace the last
layer with your classification task.
Instead of training only the last layer, we can also keep
training all the previous layers, backpropagating the
gradient through the network and adjusting the
previously learned filters for our task.
You can think of this as warm-starting a neural network
from one that was trained on another dataset.
If you do that, we often want to train the last layer a
little bit before we backpropagate through the
network. Otherwise the random initialization of the
last layer might destroy the filters that we used for
initialization.

???
Since convolutional neural nets are so good at image
recognition, some people think they are pretty
infallible. But they are not. There is this interesting
paper about intriguing properties of neural networks,
that introduces adverserial samples.
Adverserial samples are samples that were created by
an adversary or attacker to fool your model. Here,
they changed images to be classified as Ostrich by
AlexNet trained on imagenet.
The picture on the left is change just slightly, and went
from correctly classified to classified as Ostrich.
This technique uses gradient descent on the input and
requires access to all the weights in the network to
create the samples.
Given how high-dimensional the input space is, this is
not very surprising from a mathematical perspective,
but it might be somewhat unexpected.

requires the weights, done by gradient descent.
